We’ll likely want to break these sections out into their own .Rmd files as they get fleshed out. For now, I’ll try to keep the abundance of files limited.

These include: Basic Coding read/write data in/out of R basic manipulations Theoretical Basis looking at data distributions formal assessment of distributions Students will also be familiar with how these concepts are applied from Chapter 3. Hopefully students will be able to: Come up with a social science question they are interested in Critically think about target variable(s) of interest. Any a priori covariates? confounders? Acquire relevant data from IPUMS Analyze, Summarize, Visualize Data scope and complexity at student/teach discretion Present research to class potentially critically discuss/evaluate each others work. science is collaborative everyone should be out to do their best work and represent the data as best we can. We all have conscious and unconscious biases, and the best way to confront them is share and receive (respectful) feedback. During this Unit, we suggest giving ample class time for independent student research, peer-to-peer collaboration, and basic R/stats troubleshooting. This would also be a great time to model how to give respectful criticism by discussing recent research papers. * We could maybe come up with 1-2 seed examples, with a few talking points 4.1 Example one 4.2 Example two "],["ex_code.html", "Chapter 5 Example RMD code 5.1 Core 5.2 Tips 5.3 Syntax", " Chapter 5 Example RMD code For now, this chapter is a bit of a placeholder. I’m not sure what/how the references.Rmd file actually fits in to the code/construction (it looks automatic) so I want to keep that in place and need a section to note that. I also want a more centralized reference point to put any example code I find helpful while working in R/bookdown. This section could get really unrully really fast, but oh well. 5.1 Core index.Rmd is required and treated as file 00. Chapters should be numbered for ease of sorting but custom orders are possible by specifying filenames somewhere in this file Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. + IE beyond the YAML header this file functions as a normal chapter since it starts with a top level header. + Note that index.Rmd has its own YMAL in addition to the various .yml files…not sure exactly how these relate. Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. * Again, this prints an auto-generated numeral * also leaving this in the context of the plots in Chapter 1 You can write citations, too. See knitr::write_bib() for more on this. Quick example from demo/index (may not work without write_bib() though): we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). * If included, “Refernces” section gets added to each chapter. * Not exactly sure where Embed html renders (EG, fancy tables (IPUMS_var_desc), or any shiny app) with webshot R package and phantomJS. install.packages(&quot;webshot&quot;) webshot::install_phantomjs() 5.2 Tips LABEL EVERYTHING you’ll likely want to reference it later * code chunks that produce figures can be referenced via @\\ref(fig:[LABEL]) You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 2. * No idea how the automatic references work, so always be sure to declare them. * NOTE these display as the relevant Chapter numeral. 5.3 Syntax italics or italics (can handle spaces) bold code \\(equations\\) 5.3.1 Math Randal Pruim features an extensive list of common math expression on their github page. Here are some quick notes: In-line equations can be written within $ and will be displayed right there: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). In contrast, you can also add equation chunks by using $$ This can be coded in-line, \\[\\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2\\], but will result in a page break. Alternatively, a more “classic” equation chunk: $$ Plain text doesnt get spaces how very odd $$ To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX.
