It has expanded to include 9 data collections, which are united in their methods and principles of making social science research easier. IPUMS data consists of individual-level census and survey data from more than 100 countries around the world. Notably: IPUMS harmonizes these data - ensuring consistently coded values across time and space. IPUMS provides harmonized GIS Shapefiles for most census and survey data. IPUMS provides extensive metadata, including: Original questionnaire text. Universe definition and comparability statements. Alerts about notable changes in variable definition, universe, or coding schema IPUMS data is free to use for education and research purposes. Researchers need only to register with an email address and brief project description. Nothing too formal - were just trying to understand what kinds of questions researchers are interested in. For educators, we have additional resources to facilitate set up of classroom accounts - making it easy to get your students registered and share IPUMS data with them. "],["why-make-this-course.html", "Why make this course", " Why make this course In a world where information and data are increasingly accessible, it is of utmost importance for individuals to understand data science and the interpretation of data. We believe that education should be easily accessible and teaching resources should be freely available to aid in this endeavor. While we (DEE) may be slightly biased, we think IPUMS is a fantastic resource for both Education and Research. Real-world example datasets provide the bulk of the content for this course, providing an applied context we hope students (and instructors) will find engaging. We also know many instructors may be teaching across multiple disciplines, in large departments, or be the only data person at their institution. We think IPUMS data is useful to virtually any social science field. We provide some example lessons, and encourage instructors to develop their own, using our lesson_template.Rmd to tailor this course to their subject or interest.

In Unit 2, each week will showcase a method/analysis using preselected variables. In class, students will walk through a given problem set and produce a lab report by the end of class. In Unit 3, students will work towards answering a research question that they pose, creating a research paper with literature review, data analysis, conclusion, and data outputs. Course Aims Provide students with relevant, hands on, methodological training in data literacy and visualization. Learning Outcomes After this course, students will be able to: Understand the depth of the IPUMS database and the variables it has to offer Compose R code to analyze the IPUMS data Produce visually pleasing data outputs in R Synthesize the information in a written report Present the analysis in a poster format for other students Guiding Principles Phenomenon-based learning try to start the class with a question or problem why does the data look the way it does structure class so students work towards solving the problem Relevant examples Drawn from multiple disciplines (eg, economics, demography) Can be added as modular examples/exercises "],["syllabus---overview.html", "Syllabus - Overview", " Syllabus - Overview This syllabus is initially envisioned as 3 5-week sections. However, compilation and content are intended to be modular with templates for instructors to include their own specialties. The basic structure of this course is: Unit 1 (Weeks 1-5): Understanding and Testing Data Students use simple datasets bundled with the course or provided by the instructor. Simplified data to illustrate trends. EG: plotting continuous variable (AGE); Table of categorical variable (SEX); Crosstabs Unit 2 (Weeks 6-10): Finding Data and Asking Questions Students begin to analyze real world, IPUMS, datasets, provided by course/instructor. Students begin to model real world phenomena EG: SEX ~ EDUATTAIN ; SEX ~ EDATTAIN + EMPSTAT Students learn to perform exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference. Students learn to navigate IPUMS website,and find relevant data to thier research interest. Unit 3 (Weeks 11-15): Discussing Data and Student Research Students develop a research question to be answered with IPUMS data. Students are encouraged to fit it to their interests/major/discipline. Course time should be devoted to individual/small-group research. Instructor/class present on recent research. Instructor models constructive / scholarly criticism. Encourage students to critique published work - responsibly. "],["detailed-syllabus.html", "Detailed Syllabus", " Detailed Syllabus Unit 1 Understanding and Testing Data Students become gain familiarity and comfortability navigating RStudio, coding in R and performing simple data manipulation and visualization exercises. Datasets in this section consist of real-world (or synthetic) data, but the focus is on understanding data types (EG: using Age as a continuous variable; sex, education, employment as categorical; etc). Instructors should acknowledge these as educational datasets and make explicit trends found within these data are devoid of context, and must be taken with a (rather large) grain of salt, if at all. By the end of Unit 1, students will be able to: Download R and RStudio Read data into R and Write (save) data out of R Summarize data visually Using base R Using ggplot (tidyverse) Summarize data in tables Using base R Using gttable / tidyverse Formally state and test assumptions of data EG: t-test, anova, correlations, regression By the end of Unit 1, students will understand Main types of data EG: logical, numeric, character, etc R specic vs general terms How to create and describe various data distributions EG: normal, poisson, normal-skewed, etc Know which types statistical tests are appropriate for a given set of data.

Students become familiar writing up short lab reports detailing their findings. For Section 18.2, we/instructor provides students with simple datasets from IPUMS (or other real-world data). Students will learn exploratory data analysis techniques and how to create lab reports to summarize key findings. For unit 18.3, students will learn to develop their own simple research questions or social-science hypotheses. They will seek out data to answer these questions, learning to navigate ipums.org, and create data extracts, as well as hypothesis-testing statistical methods. Again, lab reports to summarize findings. 0.0.0.1 Week 6: Intro to IPUMS Week 7: Exploratory analysis If youve just collected a survey, or other raw data, you may not know what youre looking for. This is perfectly ok but goes against the scientific method most people learned in grade school. This unit begins by presenting data/distributions and asking students to begin interpreting the data . visual exploration is encouraged and basic of data manipulation are taught * EG: how to subset data, how to reshape data, how to re-code data, how to convert from one data type to another. Example lab exercise: Students given a data set (xls, csv, etc) * load data, perform manipulations, basic summaries + cross tabs + group means by a covariate * inspect data visually + DESCRIBE the distribution - is it normal? significant? * FIND aquestion in the spread of the data + how can you test this (maybe small group work) * write up/ present results + think on confounding factors / biases Week 8: Hypothesis Testing If, on the other hand you have an a pre-existing idea you want to test. We can follow the traditional scientific method. With a question in mind, the first question is: where to look. What better place than IPUMS! Begin introducing navigation of web resources - mainly IPUMS international Students should become comfortable working through lab exercises: * Define a question (or be presented with one) * Download variables from IPUMS (course downloads possible) * Perform a basic analysis (discussed in Unit 1) * Generate a visual argument for your analysis + Include explanation/interpretation/reflection on the question at hand, and the data used + Any obvious biases + Any obvious confounding factors Week 9: Statistical Inference Week 10: (TBD) Unit 3 Discussing Data and Student Research Students will select their own research question that can be answered with the IPUMS data set and will spend five weeks conducting a research project complete with data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In this section we encourage the instructor to provide ample time for independent student/small-group research. Some class time should be devoted to modeling healthy discussion and critique of methods. Students should learn to discuss not just how to answer a research question but why they are asking/answering it. What impact does the question/answers have. Is the question releveant/meaningful, and importantly, Is this research question perpetuating racist ideas. We provide some examples here but encourage instructors (or students) to bring in recent journal/popular articles that do (or do not) apply data science methods well.

You have been using online dating sites and noticed that the men you match with all report that they are 6ft or over. You become curious if this is a bias in reporting, or if the area where you live and attend college has significantly taller men. To test your theory, you want to collect data on height from individuals in your data science class to test if males are truly taller on campus than the country average. Source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/body-measurements.htm** Data is defined as facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.1 As seen in Figure 1.1, there are two types of data: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data are able to be expressed in numerical format and are countable. These data are either discrete or continuous where discrete data uses numeric bins. For example, we use our age as discrete quantitative data, we round our age to the previous year (eg., 20, 21, 22). Continuous data does not use bins, but rather includes all of the fractions between two whole numbers. An example could be most physical measures like height, weight, the speed at which an individual runs. Qualitative data describes characteristics or categories and can be broken down into two categories, nominal or ordinal. Nominal data has no inherent ordering but it can be categorized. Examples include country or origin, gender, hair color, race, etc. Ordinal data can both be categorized and orders (e.g., first, second, and third place is a race). Going back to our hypothesis of male height on campus, heights are continuous, qualitative data. It is difficult for people to report their specific height and you assume that most individuals will report it rounded to the closest inch. This makes the data you will actually use, discrete quantitative data. This is from the internet and needs to be our words "],["collecting-data.html", "2.2 COLLECTING DATA", " 2.2 COLLECTING DATA The first step to answering a research question is to collect your data. Broadly, data comes in two forms, primary and secondary. (Fig 1.2) Primary data is data that is collected directly by the researcher. Surveys, observations, experimentation, questionnaires, and interviews are all examples of primary data. Secondary data is collected from published or unpublished literature. It is collected by different researchers and compiled for use by a second scientist.This type of data includes data found in published articles, books, journals, biographies, and government records like the US Census. Once compiled, you now have a data set which is comprised of observations and variables. An observation is all of the measures taken for one person or item. A variable is what is being measured. The US CDC data is secondary, but you are collecting height data yourself in class as a comparison. The survey or questionnaire you use on your classmates is primary data. Each individual is an observation and the variable of interest is height.

You instead decide to use a sample of males in your data science class. This is a random sample as each male individual has an equally likely chance of being samples (that is, unless a prerequisite exists). Sampling strategy can lead to bias If you had chosen a different sample, like the mens basketball team, your results would have been biased.

R is a statistical programing language. Using R, researchers can write instructions (code) that performs just about any data manipulation, analization, or visualization. Some highlights from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (cran): R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics R provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear modelling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, ) and graphical techniques, and is &gt; highly extensible. The S language is often the vehicle of choice for research in statistical methodology, and R provides an Open Source route to &gt; participation in that activity. One of Rs strengths is the ease with which well-designed publication-quality plots can be produced, including mathematical symbols and formulae where needed. Great care has been taken over the defaults for the minor design choices in graphics, but the user retains full control. R is available as Free Software under the terms of the Free Software Foundations GNU General Public License in source code form.

This would also be a great time to model how to give respectful criticism by discussing recent research papers. * We could maybe come up with 1-2 seed examples, with a few talking points "],["example-one.html", "19.6 Example one", " 19.6 Example one "],["example-two.html", "19.7 Example two", " 19.7 Example two "],["ex_code.html", "Chapter 20 Example RMD code", " Chapter 20 Example RMD code For now, this chapter is a bit of a placeholder.

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure @ref(fig:norm_dist_plot). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table @ref(tab:norm_summary_tab). * Again, this prints an auto-generated numeral * also leaving this in the context of the plots in Chapter 18 You can write citations, too. See knitr::write_bib() for more on this. Quick example from demo/index (may not work without write_bib() though): we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). * If included, Refernces section gets added to each chapter. * Not exactly sure where Embed html renders (EG, fancy tables (IPUMS_var_desc), or any shiny app) with webshot R package and phantomJS. install.packages(&quot;webshot&quot;) webshot::install_phantomjs() Embed figures from a folder. For this, its usually best to use a code-chunk and knitr. There are a number of graphical paramerters you can set (or ignore) out.width will scale your image accordingly - irrespective of unit/display fig.align should be left, right, or center fig.cap allows you to provide mouse over captions for the image. echo=FALSE is important if you ONLY want the image (IE the result of the code).
