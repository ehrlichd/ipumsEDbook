Quanitative data are able to be expressed in numerical format and are countable. These data are either discrete or continuous… 1.1.3 Data Structures 1.2 Week 2: Plotting Data 1.2.1 Normal Distributions First we’ll generate a normal distribution with the rnorm() function. This takes 3 arguments: n, mean, sd, which you can see filled in below. While we could print out a list of all these values, it’s not easy to understand a list of numbers normal_dist &lt;- rnorm(n = 100, ## 100 samples mean = 10, ## with a mean of 10 sd = 1 ## and a standard deviation of 1 ) normal_dist ## [1] 8.599598 11.549236 8.372485 8.446231 7.532960 9.492829 9.925340 ## [8] 11.577570 8.474388 9.433135 9.866623 10.989876 11.960443 10.254014 ## [15] 9.265931 8.988782 6.725083 10.187834 10.245291 10.734284 7.787533 ## [22] 9.611261 11.997086 9.903942 10.980689 9.300111 11.520628 9.029120 ## [29] 10.882818 8.730818 10.349445 10.995308 10.532758 9.938942 10.144455 ## [36] 8.655762 12.171410 10.836089 9.261669 11.087441 8.420252 9.850458 ## [43] 10.771936 9.010512 7.363655 7.545340 9.473335 9.194871 9.101064 ## [50] 9.928814 8.859065 8.036924 8.864251 10.704196 9.974637 11.291433 ## [57] 10.242104 10.889863 9.932612 10.453192 8.650745 10.213872 8.366025 ## [64] 11.020566 8.882291 10.865093 9.365097 9.536810 9.927920 10.661389 ## [71] 9.965194 10.901657 10.168461 10.319010 10.666562 8.623084 10.028878 ## [78] 11.565616 10.969398 9.388016 10.441387 9.507470 9.362422 11.036244 ## [85] 11.240732 11.071958 10.491177 9.021965 7.615119 10.293261 9.394655 ## [92] 11.369032 10.162399 10.562452 9.751584 10.520380 10.376754 10.974473 ## [99] 9.967268 11.776614 Another better way to look at data would be to visualize or plot it. One way to to that is with a histogram, which groups continuous values into bins, then plots the frequency for each bin. In R, we use the hist() function to plot a histogram of data. We can (try to) control the number of bins with the breaks argument, but note that it doesn’t always match up. The hist() function will adjust based on the distribution of the data. hist(normal_dist,breaks = 5) Another way to visualize this would be with a d 1.2.2 What is normal? 1.2.2.1 Quantitative summaries 5num summary * Min, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, Max tab_normal_dist &lt;- summary(normal_dist) We can print the table in R by calling its name. tab_normal_dist ## Min. 1st Qu.

We’ll likely want to break these sections out into their own .Rmd files as they get fleshed out. For now, I’ll try to keep the abundance of files limited. NOTE: As these actually get filled out, we will probably want to insert different parts to the book (EG, the content of Unit 1 is covered in Part I). * Declare parts with # (PART) Part I {-} immediately before the first chapter # it contains. Topics to include: * What is data? * Everything can be data * How do we interpret data * Tables * Plots * Univariate distributions * What can they tell us * Multi-modality in distributions * Categorical vs continuous data * Don’t need to get ahead of this yet * Add in a grouping category - multi state/multi-national dataset * Ttest / anova Type of Data: Age distributions Specifically generate a dataset with old/young folks over-represented to highlight a bimodal distribution Start with single state/country Add a second state/country to demo ttest Add more to demo anova Alternatively, income by education level - may be more interesting/relevant to college students (or depressing) 1.6 Intro to R/RStudio 1.7 Reading Data / Distributions 1.7.1 What is a normal distribution 1.7.1.1 How normal is it? show increasingly unclear examples of normal vs not introduce tests of normality 1.7.1.2 Measuring normality - single sample reinforce [concept of statistical] normality is a value from a sample? - one way ttest something about tails 1.7.1.3 comparing normality - two saples standard / two-way t test 1.7.1.4 comparing more than two - ANOVA #Glossary Data Quantitative Qualitative Discrete Continuous Nominal Ordinal "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
