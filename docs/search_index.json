Ehrlich, IPUMS, University of Minnesota   Anna Tremblay, Dept of Soc, Anth, &amp; CJ, Clemson University   Current Version compiled: 2023-10-27 Preface An applied methods class for social scientists that uses real-world IPUMS data. This course is: Open-source and customizable -    All materials available on Github Made with open-source tools -   R, RStudio, bookdown Driven by (nearly) open-source data -   Harmonized across time and space: IPUMS Why make this course In a world where information and data are increasingly accessible, it is of utmost importance for individuals to understand data science and the interpretation of data. We believe that education should be easily accessible and teaching resources should be freely available to aid in this endeavor. While we (DEE) may be slightly biased, we think IPUMS is a fantastic resource for both Education and Research. Real-world example datasets provide the bulk of the content for this course, providing an applied context we hope students (and instructors) will find engaging. We also know many instructors may be teaching across multiple disciplines, in large departments, or be the only “data person” at their institution. We think IPUMS data is useful to virtually any social science field. We provide some example lessons, and encourage instructors to develop their own, using our lesson_template.Rmd to tailor this course to their subject or interest. What is IPUMS IPUMS started as a project to digitize the historical records of the US census. It has expanded to include 9 data collections, which are united in their methods and principles of making social science research easier. IPUMS data consists of individual-level census and survey data from more than 100 countries around the world. Notably: IPUMS harmonizes these data - ensuring consistently coded values across time and space. IPUMS provides harmonized GIS Shapefiles for most census and survey data. IPUMS provides extensive metadata, including: Original questionnaire text. Universe definition and comparability statements. Alerts about notable changes in variable definition, universe, or coding schema IPUMS data is free to use for education and research purposes. Researchers need only to register with an email address and brief project description. Nothing too formal - we’re just trying to understand what kinds of questions researchers are interested in. For educators, we have additional resources to facilitate set up of classroom accounts - making it easy to get your students registered and share IPUMS data with them. What is R R is a programming language. Learning to use R is learning how to code, which teaches logic, and programmatic thinking. Since R is a statistical programming language, it has many built-in features to facilitate a range of mathematical calculations. Since R is open-source, it is customizable and expandable! Base R refers to the core set of functions needed to run R. It’s the bare-minimum to use R, available from CRAN. Base R can be expanded by downloading add-on R packages, either from CRAN, from a github.page, or by making your own! While you can interact with R by itself, pretty much everyone agrees the experience can be better. We reccomend using Rstudio, which provides a GUI and many additional handy features that make coding in R fun! In addition to a GUI, Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which allowes a user to both write and run code, but also develop R packages ( or textbooks). NOTE: * Rstudio as an organization is now known/rebranding as posit * Rstudio as a program is now known/will be produced as quarto * This is because the quarto IDE supports python, javascript, etc in addition to R This book, and all analyses, are done using R. ADD IN CONTENT FROM CURRENT 1.2 - WHAT IS R Getting Started In order to use this textbook, you will need to: download and install RStudio This link also contains instructions and links to download R from CRAN Be sure you download the appropriate file for your Mac or PC Register for an with IPUMS account.

Unit 1 focuses on familiarizing yourself with R and the IPUMS dataset. In Unit 2, each week will showcase a method/analysis using preselected variables. In class, students will walk through a given problem set and produce a lab report by the end of class. In Unit 3, students will work towards answering a research question that they pose, creating a research paper with literature review, data analysis, conclusion, and data outputs. Course Aims Provide students with relevant, hands on, methodological training in data literacy and visualization. Learning Outcomes After this course, students will be able to: Understand the depth of the IPUMS database and the variables it has to offer Compose R code to analyze the IPUMS data Produce visually pleasing data outputs in R Synthesize the information in a written report Present the analysis in a poster format for other students Guiding Principles Phenomenon-based learning try to start the class with a question or problem why does the data look the way it does structure class so students work towards solving the problem Relevant examples Drawn from multiple disciplines (eg, economics, demography) Can be added as modular examples/exercises "],["syllabus---general.html", "Syllabus - General", " Syllabus - General This syllabus is initially envisioned as 3 5-week sections. However, compilation and content are intended to be modular with templates for instructors to include their own specialties. The basic structure of this course is: Unit 1 (Weeks 1-5): Understanding and Testing Data Students use simple datasets bundled with the course or provided by the instructor. Simplified data to illustrate trends. EG: plotting continuous variable (AGE); Table of categorical variable (SEX); Crosstabs Unit 2 (Weeks 6-10): Finding Data and Asking Questions Students begin to analyze real world, IPUMS, datasets, provided by course/instructor. Students begin to model real world phenomena EG: SEX ~ EDUATTAIN ; SEX ~ EDATTAIN + EMPSTAT Students learn to perform exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference. Students learn to navigate IPUMS website,and find relevant data to thier research interest. Unit 3 (Weeks 11-15): Discussing Data and Student Research Students develop a research question to be answered with IPUMS data. Students are encouraged to fit it to their interests/major/discipline. Course time should be devoted to individual/small-group research. Instructor/class present on recent research. Instructor models constructive / scholarly criticism. Encourage students to critique published work - responsibly. "],["syllabus---detailed.html", "Syllabus - Detailed", " Syllabus - Detailed Unit 1 Understanding and Testing Data Students become gain familiarity and comfortability navigating RStudio, coding in R and performing simple data manipulation and visualization exercises. Datasets in this section consist of real-world (or synthetic) data, but the focus is on understanding data types (EG: using Age as a continuous variable; sex, education, employment as categorical; etc). Instructors should acknowledge these as educational datasets and make explicit trends found within these data are devoid of context, and must be taken with a (rather large) grain of salt, if at all. By the end of Unit 1, students will be able to: Download R and RStudio Read data into R and Write (save) data out of R Summarize data visually Using base R Using ggplot (tidyverse) Summarize data in tables Using base R Using gttable / tidyverse Formally state and test assumptions of data EG: t-test, anova, correlations, regression By the end of Unit 1, students will understand Main types of data EG: logical, numeric, character, etc R specic vs general terms How to create and describe various data distributions EG: normal, poisson, normal-skewed, etc Know which types statistical tests are appropriate for a given set of data. Week 1: Intro to R, data types, data structures Week 2: Plotting Data, Distributions Week 3: Statisitcal testing of simple data sets Week 4: Correlation and Relationships of simple data sets Week 5: (TBD) Unit 2 Finding Data and Asking Questions (Using IPUMS Data) Here we demonstrate two different approaches to conducting research. Students become familiar writing up short lab reports detailing their findings. For Section ??, we/instructor provides students with simple datasets from IPUMS (or other real-world data). Students will learn exploratory data analysis techniques and how to create lab reports to summarize key findings. For unit ??, students will learn to develop their own simple research questions or social-science hypotheses. They will seek out data to answer these questions, learning to navigate ipums.org, and create data extracts, as well as hypothesis-testing statistical methods. Again, lab reports to summarize findings. 0.0.0.1 Week 6: Intro to IPUMS Week 7: Exploratory analysis If you’ve just collected a survey, or other raw data, you may not know what you’re looking for. This is perfectly ok but goes against the scientific method most people learned in grade school. This unit begins by presenting data/distributions and asking students to begin interpreting the data . visual exploration is encouraged and basic of data manipulation are taught * EG: how to subset data, how to reshape data, how to re-code data, how to convert from one data type to another. Example lab exercise: Students given a data set (xls, csv, etc) * load data, perform manipulations, basic summaries + cross tabs + group means by a covariate * inspect data visually + DESCRIBE the distribution - is it normal? significant? * FIND aquestion in the spread of the data + how can you test this (maybe small group work) * write up/ present results + think on confounding factors / biases Week 8: Hypothesis Testing If, on the other hand you have an a pre-existing idea you want to test. We can follow the traditional scientific method. With a question in mind, the first question is: where to look. What better place than IPUMS! Begin introducing navigation of web resources - mainly IPUMS international Students should become comfortable working through lab exercises: * Define a question (or be presented with one) * Download variables from IPUMS (course downloads possible) * Perform a basic analysis (discussed in Unit 1) * Generate a visual argument for your analysis + Include explanation/interpretation/reflection on the question at hand, and the data used + Any obvious biases + Any obvious confounding factors Week 9: Statistical Inference Week 10: (TBD) Unit 3 Discussing Data and Student Research Students will select their own research question that can be answered with the IPUMS data set and will spend five weeks conducting a research project complete with data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In this section we encourage the instructor to provide ample time for independent student/small-group research. Some class time should be devoted to modeling healthy discussion and critique of methods. Students should learn to discuss not just how to answer a research question but why they are asking/answering it. What impact does the question/answers have. Is the question releveant/meaningful, and importantly, Is this research question perpetuating racist ideas. We provide some examples here but encourage instructors (or students) to bring in recent journal/popular articles that do (or do not) apply data science methods well.

Quantitative data are able to be expressed in numerical format and are countable. These data are either discrete or continuous where discrete data uses numeric bins. For example, we use our age as discrete quantitative data, we round our age to the previous year (eg., 20, 21, 22). Continuous data does not use bins, but rather includes all of the fractions between two whole numbers. An example could be most physical measures like height, weight, the speed at which an individual runs. Qualitative data describe characteristics or categories and can be broken down into two categories, nominal or ordinal. Nominal data have no inherent ordering but it can be categorized. Examples include country or origin, gender, hair color, race, etc. Ordinal data can both be categorized and ordered (e.g., first, second, and third place is a race). Going back to our hypothesis of male height on campus, heights are continuous, qualitative data. It is difficult for people to report their specific height and you assume that most individuals will report it rounded to the closest inch. This makes the data you will actually use, discrete quantitative data. Fun fact: A single data point is called a datum which is Latin for “something given”. The word data can be either singular or plural depending on how you use it. It can be used as a mass noun the same way we discuss sand on a beach or hair on our head. However, in science we are usually referring to multiple datums within a data set making it a plural noun. Therefore, data is cool and data are cool! — Sources 1.3.2 COLLECTING DATA The first step to answering a research question is to collect your data. Broadly, data comes in two forms, primary and secondary. (Fig 1.2) Primary data are data that is collected directly by the researcher. Surveys, observations, experimentation, questionnaires, and interviews are all examples of primary data. Secondary data are collected from published or unpublished literature. It is collected by different researchers and compiled for use by a second scientist. These types of data include data found in published articles, books, journals, biographies, and government records like the US Census. Once compiled, you now have a data set which is composed of observations and variables. An observation is all of the measures taken for one person or item. A variable is what is being measured. The US CDC data is secondary, but you are collecting height data yourself in class as a comparison. The survey or questionnaire you use on your classmates is primary data. Each individual is an observation and the variable of interest is height. 1.3.2.1 “HOW do we get data??” The first step to answering a research question is to collect your data. Broadly, data comes in two forms, primary and secondary. (Fig 1.2) Primary data are data that is collected directly by the researcher. Surveys, observations, experimentation, questionnaires, and interviews are all examples of primary data. Secondary data are collected from published or unpublished literature. It is collected by different researchers and compiled for use by a second scientist. These type of data include data found in published articles, books, journals, biographies, and government records like the US Census. Once compiled, you now have a data set which is comprised of observations and variables. An observation is all of the measures taken for one person or item. A variable is what is being measured. The US CDC data is secondary, but you are collecting height data yourself in class as a comparison. The survey or questionnaire you use on your classmates is primary data. Each individual is an observation and the variable of interest is height. 1.3.2.2 TYPES OF DATA There are a lot of different ways to record observations. Its important to choose an appropriate format to record your data. Some pretty broad categories are: Yes/No Tallies Categorization Measurments Open-ended text If you were to ask your friend: “What is your favorite food?” You would not expect them to give an answer of “yes” or “no”. Asking an open-ended question often/always prompts an open-ended response. This can be informative and inclusive, allowing respondents to answer with exactly the answer they feel best answers the question. However, it can make analyzing and drawing interpretations from the data dificult to impossible! If instead, we ask “Is your favorite food pizza?” We expect a yes/no answer. Asking this question of 100 people, we can easily answer the question “What percentage of people’s favorite food is pizza?” 1.3.2.2.1 Continuous vs categorical One of the biggest differences in classifying data is based on the uniuque values we expect from the data. Continuous variables are… Categorical variables can be ordered (EG Factors, ordinations) or they can be undoredered (EG, categories) 1.3.3 POPULATIONS AND SAMPLING Random Sampling: It is a sampling method in which all the items have an equal chance of being selected and the individuals who are selected are just like the ones who are not selected Stratified Random Sampling: It is a process to gather data by separating the actual population into the distinct subset or strata, and then choosing simple random samples from each stratum Your research question is about the height of all males at your college but recording height data for each individual would be very difficult and time consuming. You instead decide to use a sample of males in your data science class. This is a random sample as each male individual has an equally likely chance of being samples (that is, unless a prerequisite exists). Sampling strategy can lead to bias. Statistical bias is a systematic tendency which causes differences between results and facts. If instead of your classmates, you had chosen a different sample, like the men’s basketball team, your results would have been biased as basketball players are taller on average. 1.3.3.1 Sample vs Population Is the study sample a representative sample of the population? 1.3.3.2 How to draw samples Random Sampling: It is a sampling method in which all the items have an equal chance of being selected and the individuals who are selected are just like the ones who are not selected Stratified Random Sampling: It is a process to gather data by separating the actual population into the distinct subset or strata, and then choosing simple random samples from each stratum Your research question is about the height of all males at your college but recording height data for each individual would be very difficult and time consuming.

Statistical bias is a systematic tendency which causes differences between results and facts. If instead of your classmates, you had chosen a different sample, like the men’s basketball team, your results would have been biased as basketball players are taller on average. 1.3.4 Study Design Considerantions - Bias is there bias in the sampling? is there bias in the data types collected? If so, Be explicit Our classroom represents a subset of individuals in this country: college aged attending college specific geography specific time period we group categories a,b,c to make new groups for analysis. In doing so, we limit our interpreations to _____ 1.3.5 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS The first step in understanding and interpreting our data is called an exploratory data analysis. We will use a few measurements to quickly look at the data and then we can use some simple graphing techniques to turn our data into visualizations. The first three M’s, you are likely familiar with and are often referred to as measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode. These go along with range, outliers and sample size. Mean Median Mode Outlier Range What is a statistic? 1.3.6 Exploring height If you do not have class data on height, we will be using the following simple dataset of 5 individuals: Can you describe what is happening in the following codechunk?? What do person, height represent in relationship to ex_height?? Click to show answer We create the R object ex_height using the assignment operator &lt;- ex_height is a data.frame, a table, with two columns: person and height person, height are the two columns, or variables, of ex_height Code ex_height &lt;- data.frame( &quot;person&quot; = paste(&quot;Ind&quot;, c(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;,&quot;c&quot;,&quot;d&quot;,&quot;e&quot;), sep = &quot;_&quot;), &quot;height&quot; = c(5.5, 5, 6, 5.25, 5) ) Code knitr::kable(ex_height) person height Ind_a 5.50 Ind_b 5.00 Ind_c 6.00 Ind_d 5.25 Ind_e 5.00 1.3.7 Mean height You probably already know this one. The (arithmatic) mean is calculated by adding all values together, and dividing by the number of observations. For our dataset, we add all 5 heights together and divide by the number of individuals (5): \\(\\frac{(5.5 + 5 + 6 + 5.25 + 5)}{5}\\) \\(\\frac{26.75}{5}\\) \\(5.35\\) In r, we can write this out “by hand.” Since r is a statistical programming language, r recognizes basic mathematical expressions. We can code the following to calcualte the mean: Code (5.5 + 5 + 6 + 5.25 + 5)/5 ## [1] 5.35 Since r is an object-oriented programming language, we don’t need to write out individual numbers for each calculation. Instead, we can refer to the ex_height object. Since ex_height is a data.frame, we can refer to it variables by name with the $ operator. We also take advantage of some of the built-in mathematical functions of r: sum(), length() Code sum(ex_height$height)/length(ex_height$person) ## [1] 5.35 1.3.8 Median height The median is calculated by ordering all values from small to large. If there are an odd numberof values, there will be a single value at the middle. Our original data: $ 5.5, 5, 6, 5.25, 5$ Our data re-ordered from small to large: $ 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 6 $ $ 5, 5, 5.25, ~~5.5, 6 ~~ $ 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 6 If we had an even number of values, we would wind up with two “middle values”, in which case we take the mean of these two. If we had one more value, let’s say 5.75, we wind up with both 5.25 and 5.5 as middle values. $ 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 5.75, 6 $ The median is the mean of these two values: \\(\\frac{5.25+5.5}{2}\\) \\(5.375\\) In a small dataset, it’s easy to pick out the middle value. Fortunately, there’s an r function for this as well: Code ## With 5 Individuals median(ex_height$height) ## [1] 5.25 Code ## With 6 individuals median(c(ex_height$height, 5.75)) ## [1] 5.375 Did you notice the c() function above? What does it do? 1.3.9 Modal height The mode is the most common value in the dataset. Here again, it’s easy to pick out there are 2 people with a height of 5, and all other values are repsented by just one person. There’s actually no build-in r function to calculate the mode… But don’t worry, there are functions that let you decide the mode and more!! A very useful function is table(), used to make counts of values. In a small dataset, we see that two individuals have a height of 5. Our mode is 5! Code table(ex_height$height) ## ## 5 5.25 5.5 6 ## 2 1 1 1 1.3.10 Range The range of the data is two numbers, the lowest, and highest values within the data: Code range(ex_height$height) ## [1] 5 6 Though, if you want just the minimum or maximum value, you can use min() or `max(): Code min(ex_height$height) ## [1] 5 Code max(ex_height$height) ## [1] 6 1.3.11 Outliers So far, some of these examples may have so obvious you may be thinking: what’s the point?? For a slightly more practical demonstration, try out the above functions on your class_data. If you don’t have class data available you can access the "],["elaborate.html", "1.4 Elaborate", " 1.4 Elaborate 1.4.1 Your Turn! (would we have done this before or is this the first time??) For this example, you can use data collected in class, or the example dataset available in ipumsED R package: class_ipums_data For in-class survey data, you are looking at the age of each individual in class. For the IPUMS data, you are looking at age as recorded in the American Community Survey (ACS). This survey is fielded annually. It contains more detailed questions that supplement the decennial census. Raw data are available directly from the US Census Bureau. However, we will be working with IPUMS data, harmonzied.. This process standardizes variable coding schema across all samples within the IPUMS dataset. IPUMS makes it easy for researchers to conduct analysis across time and space. IPUMS began as a PhD project digitizing historic US census data and reconciling it with the coding schema of the current US Census (1990s). IPUMS-International grew out of this by employing our harmonization practices on Census samples from other countries. IPUMS has partnerships with over 100 countries and is working on building partnerships with the remainng 82 countries! Partnerships with IPUMS may look slightly different for each country, but they always involve IPUMS commitment to being responsible stewards of the partner-country’s data. Our goal is to make data as open as possible, while maintaining responsible disclosure risk controls. Example data used throughout this book come from IPUMS-International so that values may be contextualized for a readers interested in one of the 103 countries that have data sharing agreements with IPUMS. Write and Rscript that reads in your chosen dataset, and calculates the following statistics: mean() meadian() mode range() In addition, include at least one plot or table and use it to discuss if your dataset contains any outliers. What criteria are you using to define an outlier? Where’s the mode()?? As a statistical programing language, R was developed with built-in functions for mean, median, and range. But mode wasn’t important enough to warrant its own function. In part, because it’s so easy to code, even you can do it! Yep, we’re serious!

Data is defined as “facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.”3 As seen in Figure 1.1, there are two types of data: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data are able to be expressed in numerical format and are countable. These data are either discrete or continuous where discrete data uses numeric bins. For example, we use our age as discrete quantitative data, we round our age to the previous year (eg., 20, 21, 22). Continuous data does not use bins, but rather includes all of the fractions between two whole numbers. An example could be most physical measures like height, weight, the speed at which an individual runs. Qualitative data describes characteristics or categories and can be broken down into two categories, nominal or ordinal. Nominal data has no inherent ordering but it can be categorized. Examples include country or origin, gender, hair color, race, etc. Ordinal data can both be categorized and ordered (e.g., first, second, and third place is a race). Going back to our hypothesis of male height on campus, heights are continuous, qualitative data. It is difficult for people to report their specific height and you assume that most individuals will report it rounded to the closest inch. This makes the data you will actually use, discrete quantitative data. 7.4.2 Collecting Data The first step to answering a research question is to collect your data. Broadly, data comes in two forms, primary and secondary. (Fig 1.2) Primary data is data that is collected directly by the researcher. Surveys, observations, experimentation, questionnaires, and interviews are all examples of primary data. Secondary data is collected from published or unpublished literature. It is collected by different researchers and compiled for use by a second scientist. This type of data includes data found in published articles, books, journals, biographies, and government records like the US Census. Once compiled, you now have a data set which is comprised of observations and variables. An observation is all of the measures taken for one person or item. A variable is what is being measured. The US CDC data is secondary, but you are collecting height data yourself in class as a comparison. The survey or questionnaire you use on your classmates is primary data. Each individual is an observation and the variable of interest is height. 7.4.3 POPULATIONS AND SAMPLING Random Sampling: It is a sampling method in which all the items have an equal chance of being selected and the individuals who are selected are just like the ones who are not selected Stratified Random Sampling: It is a process to gather data by separating the actual population into the distinct subset or strata, and then choosing simple random samples from each stratum Your research question is about the height of all males at your college, but recording height data for each individual would be very difficult and time consuming. You instead decide to use a sample of males in your data science class. This is a random sample as each male individual has an equally likely chance of being samples (that is, unless a prerequisite exists). Sampling strategy can lead to bias If you had chosen a different sample, like the men’s basketball team, your results would have been biased. This is from the internet and needs to be our words↩︎ "],["evaluation.html", "7.5 Evaluation", " 7.5 Evaluation 7.5.1 Review Questions What is one example of collecting/visualizing data from your own life Is height a continuous or discrete variable and Why? 7.5.2 Exercises Brainstorm 3 topics/questions that are of interest to you personally, or academically. * What variable(s) will you need to collect to study this phenomenon? * Describe these variable(s), are they qualitative or quantitative?

If R is the text, Rstudio is the text-editor. R is the programming language, Rstudio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). What do you think some differences are between R and RStudio? RStudio is a program/app just like Google Chrome or Microsoft Word. Each of these programs provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a pretty way for a user to use a mouse and keyboard to do something. An IDE is a special kind of program/app that provides MANY tools for writing and running code. 8.1.2 Orientation to RStudio SUGGESTION: Instructor live demos interacting with RStudio while students follow along on computers When you first open RStudio, you’ll see 3 panes, all of which will look fairly empty at the moment. If you’re using the default layout, you should see: * On the left, the Console pane * On the Top-right, the Environment pane * On the Bottom-right, the Files pane A keen eye will also notice that each of these panes contains multiple tabs. We will go over the uses of many of these tabs, but for now let’s start with Console. The Console is where you input R code, run it, and see the results. At it’s simplest RStudio is a calculator. Try typing 4 + 4 into the Console, then press the [Enter] key to run the code. Immediately, R prints the result as we see here: Code 4 + 4 ## [1] 8 The Console serves as a running log of all your operations for your current session, but it can be helpful to temporarily save your results as R objects. We do this using the assignment operator we saw earlier: &lt;- Code answer &lt;- 4+4 By default, Console only prints results if they have no where else to go. If they’re stored as an Robject, no result is printed, but you should now see answer listed in the Environment pane.

For whatever reason, this is not a default function in R, but we can easily write our own function like so: Code my_mode &lt;- function(x){ tt &lt;- table(x) ## find frequencies tt &lt;- tt[order(tt, decreasing = TRUE)] ## resort based on freq ## check number of modes max &lt;- max(tt) n_max &lt;- sum(tt==max) if(n_max &gt; 1 ){ warning(&quot;More than one mode detected&quot;) return(tt[tt==max]) } else { ## return only the first value return(tt[1]) ## return whatever the highrst frequency is } } 8.3.2 Mode Results Now that we’ve created out own function, it’s easy to find the mode Code my_mode(data$Height_inches) ## Warning in my_mode(data$Height_inches): More than one mode detected ## x ## 64 65 69 70 ## 4 4 4 4 "],["visualizing-data-1.html", "8.4 Visualizing Data", " 8.4 Visualizing Data The above summaries describe data with numbers, but we can also describe data visually. 8.4.1 Continuous Data - Boxplots Univariate continuous data, like height, can be visualized using a box and whisker plot, which shows many of the components of summary: the median is the black bar in the middle the quartiles (25th and 75th percentiles) are represented by the extents of the boxes The range is shown by the whiskers, with outliers shown indvidually, if needed. Code boxplot(data$Height_inches) 8.4.2 Continuous Data - Histograms Continuous data, can also be broken into bins and plotted as a histogram.
