This course is: Open-source and customizable -    All materials available on Github Made with open-source tools -   R, RStudio, bookdown Driven by (nearly) open-source data -   Harmonized across time and space: IPUMS Why make this course In a world where information and data are increasingly accessible, it is of utmost importance for individuals to understand data science and the interpretation of data. We believe that education should be easily accessible and teaching resources should be freely available to aid in this endeavor. While we (DEE) may be slightly biased, we think IPUMS is a fantastic resource for both Education and Research. Real-world example datasets provide the bulk of the content for this course, providing an applied context we hope students (and instructors) will find engaging. We also know many instructors may be teaching across multiple disciplines, in large departments, or be the only “data person” at their institution. We think IPUMS data is useful to virtually any social science field. We provide some example lessons, and encourage instructors to develop their own, using our lesson_template.Rmd to tailor this course to their subject or interest. What is IPUMS IPUMS started as a project to digitize the historical records of the US census. It has expanded to include 9 data collections, which are united in their methods and principles of making social science research easier. IPUMS data consists of individual-level census and survey data from more than 100 countries around the world. Notably: IPUMS harmonizes these data - ensuring consistently coded values across time and space. IPUMS provides harmonized GIS Shapefiles for most census and survey data. IPUMS provides extensive metadata, including: Original questionnaire text. Universe definition and comparability statements. Alerts about notable changes in variable definition, universe, or coding schema IPUMS data is free to use for education and research purposes. Researchers need only to register with an email address and brief project description. Nothing too formal - we’re just trying to understand what kinds of questions researchers are interested in. For educators, we have additional resources to facilitate set up of classroom accounts - making it easy to get your students registered and share IPUMS data with them. What is R R is a programming language. Learning to use R is learning how to code, which teaches logic, and programmatic thinking. Since R is a statistical programming language, it has many built-in features to facilitate a range of mathematical calculations. Since R is open-source, it is customizable and expandable! Base R refers to the core set of functions needed to run R. It’s the bare-minimum to use R, available from CRAN. Base R can be expanded by downloading add-on R packages, either from CRAN, from a github.page, or by making your own! While you can interact with R by itself, pretty much everyone agrees the experience can be better. We reccomend using Rstudio, which provides a GUI and many additional handy features that make coding in R fun! In addition to a GUI, Rstudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which allowes a user to both write and run code, but also develop R packages ( or textbooks). NOTE: * Rstudio as an organization is now known/rebranding as posit * Rstudio as a program is now known/will be produced as quarto * This is because the quarto IDE supports python, javascript, etc in addition to R This book, and all analyses, are done using R.

Unit 1 focuses on familiarizing yourself with R and the IPUMS dataset. In Unit 2, each week will showcase a method/analysis using preselected variables. In class, students will walk through a given problem set and produce a lab report by the end of class. In Unit 3, students will work towards answering a research question that they pose, creating a research paper with literature review, data analysis, conclusion, and data outputs. Course Aims Provide students with relevant, hands on, methodological training in data literacy and visualization. Learning Outcomes After this course, students will be able to: Understand the depth of the IPUMS database and the variables it has to offer Compose R code to analyze the IPUMS data Produce visually pleasing data outputs in R Synthesize the information in a written report Present the analysis in a poster format for other students Guiding Principles Phenomenon-based learning try to start the class with a question or problem why does the data look the way it does structure class so students work towards solving the problem Relevant examples Drawn from multiple disciplines (eg, economics, demography) Can be added as modular examples/exercises "],["syllabus---general.html", "Syllabus - General", " Syllabus - General This syllabus is initially envisioned as 3 5-week sections. However, compilation and content are intended to be modular with templates for instructors to include their own specialties. The basic structure of this course is: Unit 1 (Weeks 1-5): Understanding and Testing Data Students use simple datasets bundled with the course or provided by the instructor. Simplified data to illustrate trends. EG: plotting continuous variable (AGE); Table of categorical variable (SEX); Crosstabs Unit 2 (Weeks 6-10): Finding Data and Asking Questions Students begin to analyze real world, IPUMS, datasets, provided by course/instructor. Students begin to model real world phenomena EG: SEX ~ EDUATTAIN ; SEX ~ EDATTAIN + EMPSTAT Students learn to perform exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference. Students learn to navigate IPUMS website,and find relevant data to thier research interest. Unit 3 (Weeks 11-15): Discussing Data and Student Research Students develop a research question to be answered with IPUMS data. Students are encouraged to fit it to their interests/major/discipline. Course time should be devoted to individual/small-group research. Instructor/class present on recent research. Instructor models constructive / scholarly criticism. Encourage students to critique published work - responsibly. "],["syllabus---detailed.html", "Syllabus - Detailed", " Syllabus - Detailed Unit 1 Understanding and Testing Data Students become gain familiarity and comfortability navigating RStudio, coding in R and performing simple data manipulation and visualization exercises. Datasets in this section consist of real-world (or synthetic) data, but the focus is on understanding data types (EG: using Age as a continuous variable; sex, education, employment as categorical; etc). Instructors should acknowledge these as educational datasets and make explicit trends found within these data are devoid of context, and must be taken with a (rather large) grain of salt, if at all. By the end of Unit 1, students will be able to: Download R and RStudio Read data into R and Write (save) data out of R Summarize data visually Using base R Using ggplot (tidyverse) Summarize data in tables Using base R Using gttable / tidyverse Formally state and test assumptions of data EG: t-test, anova, correlations, regression By the end of Unit 1, students will understand Main types of data EG: logical, numeric, character, etc R specic vs general terms How to create and describe various data distributions EG: normal, poisson, normal-skewed, etc Know which types statistical tests are appropriate for a given set of data. Week 1: Intro to R, data types, data structures Week 2: Plotting Data, Distributions Week 3: Statisitcal testing of simple data sets Week 4: Correlation and Relationships of simple data sets Week 5: (TBD) Unit 2 Finding Data and Asking Questions (Using IPUMS Data) Here we demonstrate two different approaches to conducting research. Students become familiar writing up short lab reports detailing their findings. For Section regarding exploratory analysis, we/instructor provides students with simple datasets from IPUMS (or other real-world data). Students will learn exploratory data analysis techniques and how to create lab reports to summarize key findings. For unit dealing with hypothesis testing, students will learn to develop their own simple research questions or social-science hypotheses. They will seek out data to answer these questions, learning to navigate ipums.org, and create data extracts, as well as hypothesis-testing statistical methods. Again, lab reports to summarize findings. Week 6: Intro to IPUMS Week 7: Exploratory analysis If you’ve just collected a survey, or other raw data, you may not know what you’re looking for. This is perfectly ok but goes against the scientific method most people learned in grade school. This unit begins by presenting data/distributions and asking students to begin interpreting the data . visual exploration is encouraged and basic of data manipulation are taught * EG: how to subset data, how to reshape data, how to re-code data, how to convert from one data type to another. Example lab exercise: Students given a data set (xls, csv, etc) * load data, perform manipulations, basic summaries + cross tabs + group means by a covariate * inspect data visually + DESCRIBE the distribution - is it normal? significant? * FIND aquestion in the spread of the data + how can you test this (maybe small group work) * write up/ present results + think on confounding factors / biases Week 8: Hypothesis Testing If, on the other hand you have an a pre-existing idea you want to test. We can follow the traditional scientific method. With a question in mind, the first question is: where to look. What better place than IPUMS! Begin introducing navigation of web resources - mainly IPUMS international Students should become comfortable working through lab exercises: * Define a question (or be presented with one) * Download variables from IPUMS (course downloads possible) * Perform a basic analysis (discussed in Unit 1) * Generate a visual argument for your analysis + Include explanation/interpretation/reflection on the question at hand, and the data used + Any obvious biases + Any obvious confounding factors Week 9: Statistical Inference Week 10: (TBD) Unit 3 Discussing Data and Student Research Students will select their own research question that can be answered with the IPUMS data set and will spend five weeks conducting a research project complete with data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In this section we encourage the instructor to provide ample time for independent student/small-group research. Some class time should be devoted to modeling healthy discussion and critique of methods. Students should learn to discuss not just how to answer a research question but why they are asking/answering it. What impact does the question/answers have. Is the question releveant/meaningful, and importantly, Is this research question perpetuating racist ideas. We provide some examples here but encourage instructors (or students) to bring in recent journal/popular articles that do (or do not) apply data science methods well.

Quantitative data are able to be expressed in numerical format and are countable. These data are either discrete or continuous where discrete data uses numeric bins. For example, we use our age as discrete quantitative data, we round our age to the previous year (eg., 20, 21, 22). Continuous data does not use bins, but rather includes all of the fractions between two whole numbers. An example could be most physical measures like height, weight, the speed at which an individual runs. Qualitative data describe characteristics or categories and can be broken down into two categories, nominal or ordinal. Nominal data have no inherent ordering but it can be categorized. Examples include country or origin, gender, hair color, race, etc. Ordinal data can both be categorized and ordered (e.g., first, second, and third place is a race). Going back to our hypothesis of male height on campus, heights are continuous, qualitative data. It is difficult for people to report their specific height and you assume that most individuals will report it rounded to the closest inch. This makes the data you will actually use, discrete quantitative data. Fun fact: A single data point is called a datum which is Latin for “something given”. The word data can be either singular or plural depending on how you use it. It can be used as a mass noun the same way we discuss sand on a beach or hair on our head. However, in science we are usually referring to multiple datums within a data set making it a plural noun. Therefore, data is cool and data are cool! — Sources 1.3.2 COLLECTING DATA The first step to answering a research question is to collect your data. Broadly, data comes in two forms, primary and secondary. (Fig 1.2) Primary data are data that is collected directly by the researcher. Surveys, observations, experimentation, questionnaires, and interviews are all examples of primary data. Secondary data are collected from published or unpublished literature. It is collected by different researchers and compiled for use by a second scientist. These types of data include data found in published articles, books, journals, biographies, and government records like the US Census. Once compiled, you now have a data set which is composed of observations and variables. An observation is all of the measures taken for one person or item. A variable is what is being measured. The US CDC data is secondary, but you are collecting height data yourself in class as a comparison. The survey or questionnaire you use on your classmates is primary data. Each individual is an observation and the variable of interest is height. 1.3.2.1 “HOW do we get data??” The first step to answering a research question is to collect your data. Broadly, data comes in two forms, primary and secondary. (Fig 1.2) Primary data are data that is collected directly by the researcher. Surveys, observations, experimentation, questionnaires, and interviews are all examples of primary data. Secondary data are collected from published or unpublished literature.

The US CDC data is secondary, but you are collecting height data yourself in class as a comparison. The survey or questionnaire you use on your classmates is primary data. Each individual is an observation and the variable of interest is height. 1.3.2.2 TYPES OF DATA There are a lot of different ways to record observations. Its important to choose an appropriate format to record your data. Some pretty broad categories are: Yes/No Tallies Categorization Measurments Open-ended text If you were to ask your friend: “What is your favorite food?” You would not expect them to give an answer of “yes” or “no”. Asking an open-ended question often/always prompts an open-ended response. This can be informative and inclusive, allowing respondents to answer with exactly the answer they feel best answers the question. However, it can make analyzing and drawing interpretations from the data dificult to impossible! If instead, we ask “Is your favorite food pizza?” We expect a yes/no answer. Asking this question of 100 people, we can easily answer the question “What percentage of people’s favorite food is pizza?” 1.3.2.2.1 Continuous vs categorical One of the biggest differences in classifying data is based on the uniuque values we expect from the data. Continuous variables are… Categorical variables can be ordered (EG Factors, ordinations) or they can be undoredered (EG, categories) 1.3.3 POPULATIONS AND SAMPLING Random Sampling: It is a sampling method in which all the items have an equal chance of being selected and the individuals who are selected are just like the ones who are not selected Stratified Random Sampling: It is a process to gather data by separating the actual population into the distinct subset or strata, and then choosing simple random samples from each stratum Your research question is about the height of all males at your college but recording height data for each individual would be very difficult and time consuming. You instead decide to use a sample of males in your data science class. This is a random sample as each male individual has an equally likely chance of being samples (that is, unless a prerequisite exists). Sampling strategy can lead to bias. Statistical bias is a systematic tendency which causes differences between results and facts. If instead of your classmates, you had chosen a different sample, like the men’s basketball team, your results would have been biased as basketball players are taller on average. 1.3.3.1 Sample vs Population Is the study sample a representative sample of the population? 1.3.3.2 How to draw samples Random Sampling: It is a sampling method in which all the items have an equal chance of being selected and the individuals who are selected are just like the ones who are not selected Stratified Random Sampling: It is a process to gather data by separating the actual population into the distinct subset or strata, and then choosing simple random samples from each stratum Your research question is about the height of all males at your college but recording height data for each individual would be very difficult and time consuming.

Statistical bias is a systematic tendency which causes differences between results and facts. If instead of your classmates, you had chosen a different sample, like the men’s basketball team, your results would have been biased as basketball players are taller on average. 1.3.4 Study Design Considerantions - Bias is there bias in the sampling? is there bias in the data types collected? If so, Be explicit Our classroom represents a subset of individuals in this country: college aged attending college specific geography specific time period we group categories a,b,c to make new groups for analysis. In doing so, we limit our interpreations to _____ 1.3.5 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS The first step in understanding and interpreting our data is called an exploratory data analysis. We will use a few measurements to quickly look at the data and then we can use some simple graphing techniques to turn our data into visualizations. The first three M’s, you are likely familiar with and are often referred to as measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode. These go along with range, outliers and sample size. Mean Median Mode Outlier Range What is a statistic? 1.3.6 Exploring height If you do not have class data on height, we will be using the following simple dataset of 5 individuals: Can you describe what is happening in the following codechunk?? What do person, height represent in relationship to ex_height?? Click to show answer We create the R object ex_height using the assignment operator &lt;- ex_height is a data.frame, a table, with two columns: person and height person, height are the two columns, or variables, of ex_height person height Ind_a 5.50 Ind_b 5.00 Ind_c 6.00 Ind_d 5.25 Ind_e 5.00 1.3.7 Mean height You probably already know this one. The (arithmatic) mean is calculated by adding all values together, and dividing by the number of observations. For our dataset, we add all 5 heights together and divide by the number of individuals (5): \\(\\frac{(5.5 + 5 + 6 + 5.25 + 5)}{5}\\) \\(\\frac{26.75}{5}\\) \\(5.35\\) In R, we can write this out “by hand.” Since R is a statistical programming language, r recognizes basic mathematical expressions. We can code the following to calcualte the mean: ## [1] 5.35 Since R is an object-oriented programming language, we don’t need to write out individual numbers for each calculation. Instead, we can refer to the ex_height object. Since ex_height is a data.frame, we can refer to it variables by name with the $ operator. We also take advantage of some of the built-in mathematical functions of R: sum(), length() ## [1] 5.35 1.3.8 Median height The median is calculated by ordering all values from small to large. If there are an odd numberof values, there will be a single value at the middle. Our original data: 5.5, 5, 6, 5.25, 5 Our data re-ordered from small to large, then we simply cross off values from either end to find the middle value: 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 6 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 6 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 6 If we had an even number of values, we would wind up with two “middle values”, in which case we take the mean of these two. If we had one more value, let’s say 5.75, we wind up with both 5.25 and 5.5 as middle values. 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 5.75, 6 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 5.75, 6 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 5.75, 6 The median is the mean of these two values: \\(\\frac{5.25+5.5}{2}\\) \\(5.375\\) In a small dataset, it’s easy to pick out the middle value. Fortunately, there’s an R function for this as well: ## [1] 5.25 ## [1] 5.375 Did you notice the c() function above? What does it do? 1.3.9 Modal height The mode is the most common value in the dataset. Here again, it’s easy to pick out there are 2 people with a height of 5, and all other values are represented by just one person. There’s actually no build-in R function to calculate the mode… But don’t worry, there are functions that let you decide the mode and more!! A very useful function is table(), used to make counts of values. In a small dataset, we see that two individuals have a height of 5. Our mode is 5! ## ## 5 5.25 5.5 6 ## 2 1 1 1 1.3.10 Range The range of the data is two numbers, the lowest, and highest values within the data: ## [1] 5 6 Though, if you want just the minimum or maximum value, you can use min() or max(): ## [1] 5 ## [1] 6 1.3.11 Outliers So far, some of these examples may have so obvious you may be thinking: what’s the point?? For a slightly more practical demonstration, try out the above functions on your class_data. You can also access our heights and weights dataset is included in the accompanying ipumsED R package. There are a few ways to actually get your data into R, depending on the file type your data is saved as. If it is a .csv, you can use the base-R function read.csv(). If you have data in an Excel file (.xls, .xlsx) you will need install the readxl R package in order to use the add-on function of read.xlsx(). Notice the simliarity between read.csv() and read.xlsx()?? While packages are created by the R community, they often try to maintain syntanx/coding conventions from base R. We can inspect our data object with some basic functions. Notice how the output differs when the function is called on a data.frame versus when it is called on a vector. ## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; ## AGE SEX HEIGHT WEIGHT ## Min. : 0.00 Min. :1.000 Min. : 0.00 Min. : 0.0 ## 1st Qu.: 29.00 1st Qu.:1.000 1st Qu.:63.00 1st Qu.:136.0 ## Median : 49.00 Median :2.000 Median :66.00 Median :170.0 ## Mean : 47.56 Mean :1.517 Mean :62.84 Mean :216.4 ## 3rd Qu.: 66.00 3rd Qu.:2.000 3rd Qu.:70.00 3rd Qu.:205.0 ## Max. :997.00 Max. :2.000 Max. :99.00 Max. :999.0 ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; ## Min. 1st Qu. Median Mean 3rd Qu. Max. ## 0.00 63.00 66.00 62.84 70.00 99.00 Calling the R object itself usually prints the contents. For something this big, that’s probably inadvisable, so we print just the first 10 records using the head() function. There’s also a tail() function for printing the last 10 recods ## AGE SEX HEIGHT WEIGHT ## 1 18 1 68 130 ## 2 28 1 72 275 ## 3 3 2 0 0 ## 4 32 2 68 174 ## 5 44 1 71 180 ## 6 5 2 0 0 1.3.12 Find Outliers 1000 records is probably too much to review manually (and who would want to!?). Instead, we can visualize our data as one method to detect outliers. a box-and-whisker plot or boxplot is a common graph to plot continuous data like height. Box-and-whisker plots, by default, show you which values are outliers! The box represents the middle 75% of the dataset. The whiskers account for another 11% on either end of the box. The median is represented by a thick black line. Any observations outside the whiskers are considered outliers In this case, the values of 0, 95,96,97,98,99 all represent special coded values. 0 Indicates someone Not In Universe - someone for whom this question wasn’t asked. This may be an infant too young to meaningfully be measured. In this case higher values represent a value of unknown for various reasons. Both of these values represent missing data, but they mean different things. Why do you think we have more than one value to represent missing data? How does a value of 0 compare to a value of 99?? We may want to exclude these special cases from our analysis. We can easily perform a data modification by filtering out values that equal any of our special cases. You can see the range of the graph is smaller, though visually, the box and whiskers are larger. Do we still see outliers in height? "],["elaborate.html", "1.4 Elaborate", " 1.4 Elaborate 1.4.1 Your Turn! For this example, you can use data collected in class, or the example dataset available in ipumsED R package: class_ipums_data For in-class survey data, you are looking at the age of each individual in class. For the IPUMS data, you are looking at age as recorded in the American Community Survey (ACS). This survey is fielded annually. It contains more detailed questions that supplement the decennial census. Raw data are available directly from the US Census Bureau. However, we will be working with IPUMS data, harmonzied.. This process standardizes variable coding schema across all samples within the IPUMS dataset. IPUMS makes it easy for researchers to conduct analysis across time and space. IPUMS began as a PhD project digitizing historic US census data and reconciling it with the coding schema of the current US Census (1990s). IPUMS-International grew out of this by employing our harmonization practices on Census samples from other countries. IPUMS has partnerships with over 100 countries and is working on building partnerships with the remainng 82 countries! Partnerships with IPUMS may look slightly different for each country, but they always involve IPUMS commitment to being responsible stewards of the partner-country’s data. Our goal is to make data as open as possible, while maintaining responsible disclosure risk controls. Example data used throughout this book come from IPUMS-International so that values may be contextualized for a readers interested in one of the 103 countries that have data sharing agreements with IPUMS. Write and Rscript that reads in your chosen dataset, and calculates the following statistics: mean() meadian() mode range() In addition, include at least one plot or table and use it to discuss if your dataset contains any outliers. What criteria are you using to define an outlier? Where’s the mode()?? As a statistical programing language, R was developed with built-in functions for mean(), median(), and range(). But mode wasn’t important enough to warrant its own function. In part, because it’s so easy to code, even you can do it! Yep, we’re serious!

As responsible researchers, educators, and data analysts we have a responsiblility to carefully consider our visual arguments. An effective and responsible data visualization will lay out all relevant information (within reason), providing all the information for the reader to understand and build the visual argument for themselves. 2.3.1 Single Variable - Continuous In general, your choice of visualization will depend on the data type that you are interested in. Continuous variables often get visually summarized using histograms, or box and whisker plots. These plots all serve to visually summarize the distrubtion and skew of a continuous variable. Continuous Histogram Box Plot Summary Tables plot by index - example of not so helpful 2.3.2 Single Variable - Categorical Categorical variables, are often better visualized using bar graphs, pie charts, or other quantity/count plots.

What do you think some differences are between R and RStudio? Click to show answer R is the programming language, RStudio is the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) RStudio is a program/app just like Google Chrome or Microsoft Word. Each of these programs provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a pretty way for a user to use a mouse and keyboard to do something. An IDE is a special kind of program/app that provides MANY tools for writing and running code. Throughout this text, we will use RStudio, to write (aka, code) R-scripts that will transform, analyze, and/or visualize data. R is a language that can DO a lot. RStudio is a program that lets YOU do a lot USING the R language (and other languages). RStudio vs POSIT One last bit of definitions: POSIT is a new name/re brand of the company that produces and maintains the RStudio software. In the past, the RStudio (company) produced the RStudio (software). Now, POSIT (company) produces RStudio (software), along with Quarto (software), and other resource for data scientists. "],["how-to-install.html", "How to install", " How to install 5.5.3 R, RStudio R is available directly from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN, located at https://cran.r-project.org/. You can find the latest official and development versions of base-R and all contributed packages hosted by CRAN. You can also go straight to the POSIT website, https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/, where you can find download links for both R and Rstudio. Beyond Base R Base R Generally refers to the core set of R packages that come bundled together when you download R from CRAN or POSIT. Packages are collections of R code that can expand the functionality that is not included with the base R packages. For example, this book was made using the bookdown Rpackage which itself extends the Rmarkdown package. Together, these packages make it easy to produce high quality textbook style materials using only R!. This section will focus on using base R commands to orient users, however this book does draw on several additional packages, namely the IPUMS packages: ipumsr ipumsED ipumsEDbook (that’s the text you’re reading!) R packages need to be installed one time which downloads a copy to your local R package library. This is most often done using the install.packages() command, which whill download R packages straight from CRAN. For example, you could run the following to download the packages mentioned above. Note how the c() function is needed in order to provide a list of R packages the user wishes to download. Then, any time you want to use functionality from that package, you can use the library() function at the start of your R session. In general, your R session lasts for the entire time you are actively working. You can restart your session in order to clear your workspace, memory, etc. Or, if your computer goes to sleep, your session will also (most likely) automatically restart. Note that library() does not expect a characer string (in quotes \"\"), and that it only takes a single package name. 5.5.4 ipumsEDbook If you want to edit the book text directly, you’ll need a few additional tools. First, you’ll need the R devtools package. This can be downloaded with install.packages(devtools). You will also need Rtools, which is not an R package and must be downloaded manually from CRAN. OS-specfic versions can be found here: Windows Mac Linux In addition to devtools and Rtools, you will need GIT. GIT is a version-control system that is commonly used to track and maintain software. GIT provides MANY tools that most researchers won’t really need to interact with. The main reason we use GIT is to host a repository on a website, like github.com. By hosting our project on a remote site like github, we ensure that a version is always available. Other researchers can create a copy of their own, and download whatever the latest version. 5.5.4.1 Setting up GIT Download instructions for GIT can be found here. 5.5.4.2 Setting up GITHUB 5.5.4.3 Downloading from GITHUB Note also that while downloading ipumsEDbook provides all the source code for this document, it is unlikely that you would ever need to load the package with library(). Instead, you can use the following notation to call a specific function without loading the entire package. In this case, we call a function which will regenerate the html version of this document. "],["navigating-rstudio.html", "Navigating RStudio", " Navigating RStudio Lots of Panes, not a pain! You get used to it, promise. 5.5.5 Console The console is where you interact with R directly. The console is technically where you input the code to be run in R. 5.5.5.1 Simple Code At its simplest, R is a calculator. You can enter basic math equations into the console like. R will read the input, interpret it, and print some kine of output. The exact output you receive depends on the input! ## [1] 4 As a statistical programming language, R is capable of basic arithmetic and following order of operations. ## [1] 8 5.5.5.2 R Objects R is also an object oriented programming language. This means you can create R-objects. These objects can store complicated input or output. R objects can really be anything, and R objects can be used to create new types, or classes of other R objects. Let’s start simple. Try to describe, in plain language, what’s going on in the code below. In other words, how do you as a human, interpret the code. What do you think will happen when we run the code Click to show answer In the code chunk above, we create a new R object called my_answer. This object is the result or sum of the numbers 1 through 9. So what is my_answer??? In the above code chunk, we add up the numbers 1 through 9 and save the result to a new R object, which we call my_answer. R will print results by default, as we saw in the first math expressions. But in the above codechunk, we “catch” the result, so to speak, in out R object. We can access the result by calling the R object by name. ## [1] 45 R functions In addition to objects, a second important concept to programming in R is functions. Functions are actually just a special class of R object. What makes functions special is that they do something. In general functions take one or more arguments as input, they do some kind of action like calculations, visualizations, or data transformations, and the produce some kind of output R functions are easily recognizable because they end in parentheses (). Arguments to the function go within the parentheses. Instead of typing the + sign multiple times, as we did above, we could use the sum() function. In the code on the right, we pass the numbers 1 though 9 as arguments to the sum() function. The arguments go within the () separated by commas. .pull-left[ ## [1] 45 ] .pull-right[ ## [1] 45 ] When we create objects in R, we use &lt;-, which is known as the assignment operator. The assignment operator is a special function. instead of using (), Everything to the right of the assignment operator is taken as the input. Whatever is to the left of the assignment operator is also input! This becomes the name of the R object. The output of the assignment operator is the R object itself. ## [1] 45 Notice how we create the object, my_sum and then call the object, by name, on the next line, in order to print the results. Be careful! The assignment operator does have some limitations on what it can/can’t take as input. Try to run the following code in your own R session: If you can’t run the code, click to show result Error: unexpected &#39;,&#39; in &quot;my_sum &lt;- 1,&quot; So what went wrong?? Technically, the assignment operator is expecting just one thing to the right of it. In the working code my_sum &lt;- sum(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) , R interprets, or evaluates, the sum() function, calculating a result that is a single value, 45, which we give the name my_sum. If you want to store a list of values, you need to concatenate them first. This is probably a common concept to anyone with some kind of programing experience before. To concatenate something is simply to put it together. In R, you will get very used to using the concatenate function - in fact, it’s so common the creators of R wisely gave it a very simple, easy to remember name: c(). Using c() is easy. It takes any number of inputs, and joins them together into a single vector. A vector is an R object that lists several values. Notice the difference? .pull-left[ ## [1] 45 ] .pull-right[ ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ] 5.5.5.3 Calling functions on objects We can use some basic R functions to interact with our R objects. The first function tells us the class of our R object. While length() tells us how long the object is. Notice how my_value and my_vector have the same class, but different lengths. .pull-left[ ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## [1] 1 ] .pull-right[ ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; ## [1] 9 ] There is technically no end to the number of R object classes that can exist in R. That’s because classes can be built upon and modified to suit specialized purporses. Creating your own object classes is an advanced topic, for now, you will be interacting with pretty basic classes of objects. Below are several different vectors that represent some of the most basic object classes. Notice how these classes align closely with data classes. A vector stores one or more values of the same type of data. If we want to combine multiple vectors together, we can do that with the data.frame() function. This function takes multiple vectors as inputs and combines them together into a single object, as long as they’re the same length! .pull-left[ Why does this data.frame fail?? ] .pull-right[ ] Notice the arguments we pass to data.frame(). Do you see how each piece fits together? Can describe how each argument goes from input to output? Click to show answer In this example, we pass data.frame() three arguments, each separated by a comma ,. In each argument, we specify an R object to the right of an equal sign = and a character string within quotes \"\" to the left of the equal sign. The characters to the left of the equal sign become the names of each column. The R objects, specified verbatim, become the contents of each column. logical numeric character TRUE 1 a TRUE 2 b FALSE 3 c TRUE 4 d FALSE 5 e TRUE 6 f FALSE 7 g FALSE 8 h TRUE 9 i You’re bound to create MANY R objects throughout your work, and that can be a lot to keep track of. Fortunately, you don’t need to track this all yourself - that’s what the environment tab is for! 5.5.6 Environments (The 2nd Pane) Finally, we come to the second tab of Rstudio. In addition to Environment, you may see tabs for History, Connections. You may also see tabs for Build or Git depending on if you have these tools installed. While you may interact with these other tabs depending on your project needs, you will always want to reference R objects stored in your local environment. In the environment panel, you will find each R object listed by name and organized broadly into categories of Values (vectors), Data (data frames, matrices, and other more complex structures), User-created Functions will also receive their own section. Your local environent is a temporary space. When you close your R session, you will lose any work you do not save or write out to a separate file. Of course, that doesn’t mean you can’t re-run old code, and it doesn’t mean that you can’t save your progress in between sessions. In fact, there are Several options for how RStudio handles your environment. By default, R will attempt to preserve a copy of all data in your local environement. It will also try to restore whatever you were working on most recently when you open a new session. These may seem like handy convenience features, but in practice we find them prone to cause issues (outlined below). 5.5.6.1 Our Reccomendations Here we outline what we consider to be best practice for maintaining an R environment/ R project. 5.5.6.1.1 Global Options For the most part, we strive to use the default installations/parameters when using R/Rstudio. This facilitates reproducibility for a researcher working across different computers, and reproducibility if a colleague wishes to replicate the code themselves. However, one setting we DO recommend changing the following under Tools/Global Options/General Uncheck all boxes that begin Restore.. Restore last R project Restore previous source files Restore .RData Also, we recommend changing the option for Save a copy of .RData to NEVER. The reason for this is that if an R session crashes, trying to load the latest autogenerated backup is likely to cause the error and make the session fail again. It can also be timely if you last worked on a really large project that takes a while to open and restore all files. In practice, it’s better to intentionally save and close your project. Then open up whichever project you want to work on each time you start a new R session. 5.5.7 Files, Plots, Packages, oh my! (The 3rd Pane) The bottom-right pane (by default) contains a lot of tabs, many of which you will likely use! They functions of these tabs are largely self explanatory. Files provides a file browser, which defaults to your working directory. Usually, your working directory is the same as your R Project Folder. Plots is a graphical device, this is where (most) data visualizations will be rendered by default. Past plots can be viewed with the arrow keys, and new ones will be placed last in the sequence. NOTE: these plots are temporary renders made for your current R session. Be sure to export any visualizations if you will need to access them later. Packages lists all the R packages you currently have installed on your machine. The check box can be used to load packages as desired. In fact, clicking the check box is the same as the library() function, which in practice, is usually the preffered way to load packages. Remember, you only need to install.packages() once, but you need to load R packages with library() each session. The Help tab provides direct access to the help files housed within R. Each function should have a helpfile which you can search for by name. Alternatively, you can press F1 while your cursor is located at the end of a function name, but before the opening parentheses. The Viewer and Presentation panes will be used if you are using certain R packages that produce special outputs. See various package-specific help fules for those. 5.5.8 Writing R in Scripts (Breaking the 4th Pane) Save your work, find typos, re-run easy! Up until now, you’ve likely have been passing code directly to Console. While it makes it easy to hit the ground running, this aproach is not very efficient for actually conducting a project. Entering code line-by-line is error prone and does not provide an easy reference of the work you have done. Instead of entering code directly to console, we usually want to save our work in the form of an R script. An R script is simply a text document that contains R code. Importantly, it is assumed that everything within the Rscript is R code to be run. "],["reveiw-of-r-specific-quirks.html", "Reveiw of R-specific Quirks", " Reveiw of R-specific Quirks Here is a summary of some of the information outlined previously. 5.5.9 Global options refer to the global options outlined above R objects, Functions R is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in R is either an object or a function. R objects generally store or define some kind of data. R functions, generally, take R objects as input, do some kind of operation, and produce some kind of output. In the context of language, objects are the nouns and functions are the verbs. When you write R code, you usually create R objects that represent data of interest, then apply various R functions to transform, analyze, or visualize the data. In the below code, we are creating an object called my_data, which represents the integers one through 10. We are using the c() function which takes any number of input objects as input and concatenates them together into a character string. The input(s) to a function go within the parentheses separated by commas. You can usually tell the difference between R objects and R functions because R functions always have () written after their name. In most cases, the output of an R function will be printed to the console, unless it is saved into a new R object. We do this using the assignment opperator, &lt;-. This is a special function R function that takes whatever is on the right-hand side of the &lt;- and creates or overwrites an R object with the name specified to the left-hand side of the &lt;-. In the example below, we use the assignment opperator to “catch” the result of the c(), which is the character string of integers from 1 to 10. Calling the name of an R object will usually print its contents in the console. ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 We say usually because objects have different properties depending on their class. NOTE: We sometimes use the term class to refer to the class of data of something. Is a given number sequence comprised of integers, factors, or real numbers? In R, and in this text, when we use class we are explicitly referring to the R-object-class of an object. Because R is a statistical programming language, the data-class of an object and the object-class of an object are sometimes synonymous (EG factors, logical, character), other times, the names may be slightly different (EG the R-class numeric comprises both integer numbers and complex numbers). 5.5.10 R classes R classes determine the characteristics of the R object. They may set parameters about what kind of data can/can’t be included in the R object. They may also define or modify preset ways these R objects interact with other R objects. You can use the class() function on any R object to find out it’s class(es). That’s right, an R object can have more than one class. Some basic R classes are vectors, data,frames, and functions. That’s right! a function is actually just a certain class of R object. You can see below that in our example, my_data hass the class vector. ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; 5.5.11 R Projects, R packages R projects are an essential way to organize your data analysis, research, or even scratch work in R. Projects let you create self-contained environments that can feature their own R libraries, containg packages that are different from your day-to-day operations. R packages are collections of R functions and R objects (datasets) that extend the functionality of R. In general, an R package is also an R project. However, an R project, doesn’t have to be an R package. 5.5.12 R code vs R scripts vs R markdown R code can go anywhere. It gets input into the console to actually run the commands. But if you want to keep a record of your code and document it, you probably want to write an R script. A script is simply a text file, that contains code. Presumably, the code takes some inputs, does some operations, and produces helpful output. Sometimes we use scripts as a start-to-finish record of what we did in our work. This is often the case for research projects. A script might read data from a source, analyze it, visualize it, and save out results. If we ever need to re-do this work, it’s as simple as “re-runing” the script (literally a click of a button). Scripts can also be helpful to automate workflows. If the same data transofrmations need to occur across many samples, a script can be written to iterate across a set of inputs, perform the same calculations/transformations, and output results in some way. R markdown is just another script, but has a few more bells and whistles that make writing and documenting code a much more enjoyable experience. In fact, this whole book was written using Rmarkdown!! How to find help 5.5.12.1 In R All R functions should come with their hown help file. There are a few different ways to access this page. In RStudio, you can click on the Help tab of the File/Plots/Packages…(HELP, Viewer, Presentation) panel - the Lower-Right panel by default. Here the serach box will search the help files for any R package you have installed. You could also access the help files by pressing the F1 key while your cursor is at the end of an r function. todo: Screenshot of cursor placement after function name, before open parentheses 5.5.12.2 the web! Google (or duck-duck-go or, i guess, bing) it! “How to calculate area under the curve in R” You may be directed directly to an R package tailor made for that purpose. In this case, the AUC package was the first result from the official CRAN page. You can search CRAN if you know you want a package to do a particular thing. Alternatively, doing an internet search for a specific error message will often yield results on stackexchange or stackoverflow. These are two public sites where users submit responses and upvote helpful responses while downvoting unhelpful ones. NOTE: posting directly to these sites CAN be helpful, but oftentimes someone has already asked the question and doing an internet search will get you the answer more quickly. In general, people don’t put out bad or malicious information about R, so you can trust any reasonable responses from the above websites. In addition, there are a few notable people or teams who consistently put out good (read amazing) R-related tips/help.

You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/. 5.5.23 Hyperlinks In short, if you label it, you can link to it. So it’s good practice to LABEL EVERYTHING DESCRIPTIVELY in case you it later. There are a couple of differnt styles of labeling depending on what you want to link to. You already saw above how to link to a website (URL). code chunks that produce figures can be referenced via @\\ref(fig:[LABEL]) 5.5.23.1 Link to chapters You can label chapter, section, or any level of header (##) using by including the label in curly brackets after the section. * e.g., we can reference @ref(unit1_ch1) using the following: + \\@ref(unit1_ch1) NOTE: If you do not manually label sections, they will get automatic labels anyway, which are hard to reference, so best to just declare them. 5.5.23.2 Link to figures, tables, or code chunks You can link to figures or tables created by R code, or the R code itself, as long as they are labeled. Be careful!! if labels are not descriptive and informative, it might be hard to find them later. * We should decide on some conventions for this!* Whatever the output (figure, table, etc), the label follows the r at the very first line of the code chunk: * {r an_example}` *{r an_example, fig.cap = “Example that include additional code chunk parameters”}` To include the link in text, use the \\@ref(). To link to the code itself, we simply call the label (just like linking to a section header). * \\@ref(basic_code) Link to some basic code @ref(basic_code) If the output is a figure, you will also need to preface the label with fig: * \\@ref(fig:height_boxplot). Is the code that produces this link to a figure @ref(fig:height_boxplot) In order to reference a nicely formatted table, made with knitr::kable(), use the following: * \\@ref(tab:height_table). In order to reference this table @ref(tab:height_table) 5.5.23.3 Link to websites linking to external websites is easy, just include the text-to-be-hyperlinked This is actuall the exact same as linking to a local .jpg or similar. 5.5.24 Citations There do appera to be tools for citations, but I’m not super familiar with them so this section will grow as I learn more. 5.5.24.1 Citing R packages You can easily gather a list of all R packages used in a project using knitr::write_bib(). By using square brackets and the @ sign, along with the package name? or maybe the github repo?
