Ehrlich, IPUMS, University of Minnesota   Anna Tremblay, Dept of Soc, Anth, &amp; CJ, Clemson University   Current Version compiled: 2022-09-09 Preface An applied methods class for social scientists that uses real-world IPUMS data. This course is: Open-source and customizable -    All materials available on Github Made with open-source tools -   R, RStudio, bookdown Driven by (nearly) open-source data -   Harmonized across time and space, IPUMS What is IPUMS IPUMS started as a project to digitize the historical records of the US census. It has expanded to include 9 data collections, which are united in their methods and principles of making soial science research easier. IPUMS data consists of individual-level census and survey data from more than 100 countries around the world. Notably: IPUMS harmonizes these data, ensuring consistently coded values across time and space. IPUMS provides harmonized GIS Shapefiles for most census and survey data. IPUMS provides extensive metadata, including: Original questionnaire text Alerts about notable changes in variable definition, universe, or coding IPUMS data is free to use for education and research purposes. Researchers just need to register with an email address and brief project description. Nothing too formal - we’re just trying to understand what kinds of questions researchers are interested in. For educators, we have additional resources to set up classroom accounts, making it easy to get your students registered and share IPUMS data with them. Why make this course In a world where information and data are increasingly accessible, it is of utmost importance for individuals to understand data science and the interpretation of data. We believe that education should be easily accessible and teaching resources should be freely available to aid in this endeavor. While we (DEE) may be slightly biased, we think IPUMS is a fantastic resource for Education and Research. Real-world example datasets provide the bulk of the content for this course, providing an applied context we hope students (and instructors) will find engaging. We also know many instructors may be teaching across multiple disciplines, in large departments, or be the only “data person” at their institution. We think IPUMS data will be useful to virtually any social science field. We provide some example lessons, and encourage instructors to develop their own, using our **template**, to tailor this course to their subject or interest. "],["course-description.html", "Course Description Course Aims Learning Outcomes Guiding Principles", " Course Description This course is broken down into 3, 5-week units. Unit 1 focuses on familiarizing yourself with R and the IPUMS dataset. In Unit 2, each week will showcase a method/analysis using preselected variables. In class, students will walk through a given problem set and produce a lab report by the end of class. In Unit 3, students will work towards answering a research question that they pose, creating a research paper with literature review, data analysis, conclusion, and data outputs. Course Aims Provide students with relevant, hands on, methodological training in data literacy and visualization. Learning Outcomes After this course, students will be able to: Understand the depth of the IPUMS database and the variables it has to offer Compose R code to analyze the IPUMS data Produce visually pleasing data outputs in R Synthesize the information in a written report Present the analysis in a poster format for other students Guiding Principles Phenomenon-based learning try to start the class with a question or problem why does the data look the way it does structure class so students work towards solving the problem Relevant examples Drawn from multiple disciplines (eg, economics, demography) Can be added as modular examples/exercises "],["syllabus---overview.html", "Syllabus - Overview Detailed Syllabus", " Syllabus - Overview This syllabus is initially envisioned as 3 5-week sections. However, compilation and content are intended to be modular with templates for instructors to include their own specialties. The basic structure of this course is: Unit 1 (Weeks 1-5): Understanding and Testing Data Students use simple datasets bundled with the course or provided by the instructor. Simplified data to illustrate trends. EG: plotting continuous variable (AGE); Table of categorical variable (SEX); Crosstabs Unit 2 (Weeks 6-10): Finding Data and Asking Questions Students begin to analyze real world, IPUMS, datasets, provided by course/instructor. Students begin to model real world phenomena EG: SEX ~ EDUATTAIN ; SEX ~ EDATTAIN + EMPSTAT Students learn to perform exploratory analysis, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference. Students learn to navigate IPUMS website,and find relevant data to thier research interest. Unit 3 (Weeks 11-15): Discussing Data and Student Research Students develop a research question to be answered with IPUMS data. Students are encouraged to fit it to their interests/major/discipline. Course time should be devoted to individual/small-group research. Instructor/class present on recent research. Instructor models constructive / scholarly criticism. Encourage students to critique published work - responsibly. Detailed Syllabus Unit 1 Understanding and Testing Data Students become gain familiarity and comfortability navigating RStudio, coding in R and performing simple data manipulation and visualization exercises. Datasets in this section consist of real-world (or synthetic) data, but the focus is on understanding data types (EG: using Age as a continuous variable; sex, education, employment as categorical; etc). Instructors should acknowledge these as educational datasets and make explicit trends found within these data are devoid of context, and must be taken with a (rather large) grain of salt, if at all. By the end of Unit 1, students will be able to: Download R and RStudio Read data into R and Write (save) data out of R Summarize data visually Using base R Using ggplot (tidyverse) Summarize data in tables Using base R Using gttable / tidyverse Formally state and test assumptions of data EG: t-test, anova, correlations, regression By the end of Unit 1, students will understand Main types of data EG: logical, numeric, character, etc R specic vs general terms How to create and describe various data distributions EG: normal, poisson, normal-skewed, etc Know which types statistical tests are appropriate for a given set of data. Week 1: Intro to R, data types, data structures Week 2: Plotting Data, Distributions Week 3: Statisitcal testing of simple data sets Week 4: Correlation and Relationships of simple data sets Week 5: (TBD) Unit 2 Finding Data and Asking Questions (Using IPUMS Data) Here we demonstrate two different approaches to conducting research. Students become familiar writing up short lab reports detailing their findings. For Section 2.2, we/instructor provides students with simple datasets from IPUMS (or other real-world data). Students will learn exploratory data analysis techniques and how to create lab reports to summarize key findings. For unit 2.3, students will learn to develop their own simple research questions or social-science hypotheses. They will seek out data to answer these questions, learning to navigate ipums.org, and create data extracts, as well as hypothesis-testing statistical methods. Again, lab reports to summarize findings. 0.0.0.1 Week 6: Intro to IPUMS Week 7: Exploratory analysis If you’ve just collected a survey, or other raw data, you may not know what you’re looking for. This is perfectly ok but goes against the scientific method most people learned in grade school. This unit begins by presenting data/distributions and asking students to begin interpreting the data . visual exploration is encouraged and basic of data manipulation are taught * EG: how to subset data, how to reshape data, how to re-code data, how to convert from one data type to another. Example lab exercise: Students given a data set (xls, csv, etc) * load data, perform manipulations, basic summaries + cross tabs + group means by a covariate * inspect data visually + DESCRIBE the distribution - is it normal? significant? * FIND aquestion in the spread of the data + how can you test this (maybe small group work) * write up/ present results + think on confounding factors / biases Week 8: Hypothesis Testing If, on the other hand you have an a pre-existing idea you want to test. We can follow the traditional scientific method. With a question in mind, the first question is: where to look. What better place than IPUMS! Begin introducing navigation of web resources - mainly IPUMS international Students should become comfortable working through lab exercises: * Define a question (or be presented with one) * Download variables from IPUMS (course downloads possible) * Perform a basic analysis (discussed in Unit 1) * Generate a visual argument for your analysis + Include explanation/interpretation/reflection on the question at hand, and the data used + Any obvious biases + Any obvious confounding factors Week 9: Statistical Inference Week 10: (TBD) Unit 3 Discussing Data and Student Research Students will select their own research question that can be answered with the IPUMS data set and will spend five weeks conducting a research project complete with data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In this section we encourage the instructor to provide ample time for independent student/small-group research. Some class time should be devoted to modeling healthy discussion and critique of methods. Students should learn to discuss not just how to answer a research question but why they are asking/answering it. What impact does the question/answers have. Is the question releveant/meaningful, and importantly, Is this research question perpetuating racist ideas. We provide some examples here but encourage instructors (or students) to bring in recent journal/popular articles that do (or do not) apply data science methods well. Week 11: Students develop research Question Week 12: Students find relevant variables from IPUMS Week 13: Students test and evaluate results Week 14: Students prepare presentations of results Week 15: Students present work (slides, poster, podium, etc) "],["dev-notes.html", "DEV NOTES", " DEV NOTES TO DO Make chapter 1 chapter 2 Anna Adds chapter con data science intro exclusive of R/IPUMS discuss style key terms section for each chapter? key terms in bold italics for emphasis are we pro-hyphens, or are they pedantic?

One way to to that is with a histogram, which groups continuous values into bins, then plots the frequency for each bin. In R, we use the hist() function to plot a histogram of data. We can (try to) control the number of bins with the breaks argument, but note that it doesn’t always match up. The hist() function will adjust based on the distribution of the data. hist(normal_dist,breaks = 5) Another way to visualize this would be with a d 1.2.2 What is normal? 1.2.2.1 Quantitative summaries 5num summary * Min, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, Max tab_normal_dist &lt;- summary(normal_dist) We can print the table in R by calling its name. tab_normal_dist ## Min. 1st Qu.

We can follow the traditional scientific method. With a question in mind, the first question is: where to look. What better place than IPUMS! Begin introducing navigation of web resources - mainly IPUMS international Students should become comfortable working through lab exercises: * Define a question (or be presented with one) * Download variables from IPUMS (course downloads possible) * Perform a basic analysis (discussed in Unit 1) * Generate a visual argument for your analysis + Include explanation/interpretation/reflection on the question at hand, and the data used + Any obvious biases + Any obvious confounding factors 2.4 Week 9 Statistical Inference 2.5 Week 10 (TBD) Some text to break up the sub-section headers 2.6 Intro to IPUMS website 2.6.1 background on ipums 2.6.2 navigating website Find certain (very common) variables to answer (common) social science questions. We describe our methods in this chapter. Math can be added in body using usual syntax as follows. This may be useful, particularly for explaining the math side of things. 2.7 math example \\(p\\) is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated \\[ SE = \\sqrt(\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027 \\] You can also use math in footnotes like this1. Footnotes are helpful because they re-link to where you left off. We will approximate standard error to 0.0272 The longnote footnote seems particularly useful. where we mention \\(p = \\frac{a}{b}\\)↩︎ \\(p\\) is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated \\[ SE = \\sqrt(\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \\approx \\sqrt{\\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027 \\]↩︎ "],["unit3.html", "Chapter 3 Unit 3: Independent Research 3.1 Week 11: Students develop research Question 3.2 Week 12: Students find relevant variables from IPUMS 3.3 Week 13: Students test and evaluate results 3.4 Week 14: Students prepare presentations of results 3.5 Week 15: Students present work (slides, poster, podium, etc) 3.6 Example one 3.7 Example two", " Chapter 3 Unit 3: Independent Research Students will select their own research question that can be answered with the IPUMS data set and will spend five weeks conducting a research project complete with data analysis, visualization, and interpretation. In this section we encourage the instructor to provide ample time for independent student/small-group research. Some class time should be devoted to modeling healthy discussion and critique of methods. Students should learn to discuss not just how to answer a research question but why they are asking/answering it. What impact does the question/answers have. Is the question releveant/meaningful, and importantly, Is this research question perpetuating racist ideas. We provide some examples here but encourage instructors (or students) to bring in recent journal/popular articles that do (or do not) apply data science methods well. 3.1 Week 11: Students develop research Question 3.2 Week 12: Students find relevant variables from IPUMS 3.3 Week 13: Students test and evaluate results 3.4 Week 14: Students prepare presentations of results 3.5 Week 15: Students present work (slides, poster, podium, etc) By this point, students should be familiar with basic concepts from Chapter 1. These include: Basic Coding read/write data in/out of R basic manipulations Theoretical Basis looking at data distributions formal assessment of distributions Students will also be familiar with how these concepts are applied from Chapter 2. Hopefully students will be able to: Come up with a social science question they are interested in Critically think about target variable(s) of interest. Any a priori covariates? confounders? Acquire relevant data from IPUMS Analyze, Summarize, Visualize Data scope and complexity at student/teach discretion Present research to class potentially critically discuss/evaluate each others work. science is collaborative everyone should be out to do their best work and represent the data as best we can. We all have conscious and unconscious biases, and the best way to confront them is share and receive (respectful) feedback. During this Unit, we suggest giving ample class time for independent student research, peer-to-peer collaboration, and basic R/stats troubleshooting. This would also be a great time to model how to give respectful criticism by discussing recent research papers. * We could maybe come up with 1-2 seed examples, with a few talking points 3.6 Example one 3.7 Example two "],["ex_code.html", "Chapter 4 Example RMD code 4.1 Core 4.2 Tips 4.3 Syntax", " Chapter 4 Example RMD code For now, this chapter is a bit of a placeholder. I’m not sure what/how the references.Rmd file actually fits in to the code/construction (it looks automatic) so I want to keep that in place and need a section to note that. I also want a more centralized reference point to put any example code I find helpful while working in R/bookdown. This section could get really unrully really fast, but oh well. 4.1 Core index.Rmd is required and treated as file 00. Chapters should be numbered for ease of sorting but custom orders are possible by specifying filenames somewhere in this file Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. + IE beyond the YAML header this file functions as a normal chapter since it starts with a top level header. + Note that index.Rmd has its own YMAL in addition to the various .yml files…not sure exactly how these relate. Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure @ref(fig:norm_dist_plot). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table @ref(tab:norm_summary_tab). * Again, this prints an auto-generated numeral * also leaving this in the context of the plots in Chapter 2 You can write citations, too. See knitr::write_bib() for more on this. Quick example from demo/index (may not work without write_bib() though): we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015). * If included, “Refernces” section gets added to each chapter. * Not exactly sure where Embed html renders (EG, fancy tables (IPUMS_var_desc), or any shiny app) with webshot R package and phantomJS. install.packages(&quot;webshot&quot;) webshot::install_phantomjs() 4.2 Tips *Autonumber sections Note the {-} used to indicate “do not number this section” eg: preface. LABEL EVERYTHING you’ll likely want to reference it later * code chunks that produce figures can be referenced via @\\ref(fig:[LABEL]) You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, * No idea how the automatic references work, so always be sure to declare them. * NOTE these display as the relevant Chapter numeral. 4.3 Syntax italics or italics (can handle spaces) bold code \\(equations\\) 4.3.1 Math Randal Pruim features an extensive list of common math expression on their github page. Here are some quick notes: In-line equations can be written within $ and will be displayed right there: \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). In contrast, you can also add equation chunks by using $$ This can be coded in-line, \\[\\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2\\], but will result in a page break. Alternatively, a more “classic” equation chunk: $$ Plain text doesnt get spaces how very odd $$ To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.
