# dev-Appendix : Styling with RMD { .unnumbered}



For now, this chapter is a bit of a placeholder. I'm not sure what/how
the `references.Rmd` file actually fits in to the code/construction (it
looks automatic) so I want to keep that in place and need a section to
note that.


I also want a more centralized reference point to put any example code I
find helpful while working in R/bookdown. This section could get really
unruly really fast, but oh well.




## Navigating the bookdown {.unnumbered}


All chapter files need a 2 digit prefix (except `index.Rmd`) which
dictates the chapter order. Note, this is not automatic and a little
tedious to re-do. 

* `index.Rmd` is a required file and treated as file
`00`. 

* Chapters *should* be numbered for ease of sorting but custom
orders are possible by specifying filenames somewhere `in a certain file...but i'm not sure where`.


Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter
is defined by the first-level heading `#`. 
  * Unlike usual Rmd files, chapters DO not contain a YAML header 
  * Note that `index.Rmd` has its own YMAL for the title page and some bookwide parameters.



## Include Images {.unnumbered}


### Figures in a folder



Embed figures from a folder.

For this, it's usually best to use a code-chunk and `knitr`. There are a
number of graphical paramerters you can set (or ignore) `out.width` will
scale your image accordingly - irrespective of unit/display `fig.align`
should be "left", "right", or "center" `fig.cap` allows you to provide
"mouse over" captions for the image. `echo=FALSE` is important if you
ONLY want the image (IE the result of the code). If you want the code
itself to show, (IE, or echo) set `echo=TRUE`.

```{r, out.width= '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='the ipums logo', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/ipums_i_logo.jpg")
```


### Fancy renders


Embed html renders (EG, fancy tables (IPUMS_var_desc), or any shiny app)
with `webshot` R package and `phantomJS`.



```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("webshot")
webshot::install_phantomjs()
```

## Tips {.unnumbered}

  * Each section (chapters) gets **AUTOMATIC NUMBERING** 
    + Use `{-}` or `{.unnumbered}` to keep a section out of the auto-list. These will still be listed in the TOC
    + To hide the heading from the TOC you can also use {.unlisted}


## Basic Fonts {.unnumbered}

In a list:

-   *italics*

-   **bold**

-   `code`

-   $equations$

In *a sentence* **with differently** `formated fonts` and maths \$ a + b
= c? \$.

### More on Math

Randal Pruim features an extensive list of common math expression on
their [github
page](https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html). Here
are some quick notes:

In-line equations can be written within `$` and will be displayed right
there: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. In contrast, you can also add equation-chunks
by using `$$`

This can be coded in-line, $$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$, but will result in a
page break.

$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be
approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$





## Linking and Crossrefs {.unnumbered}

There are a few different options here: 


  * Footnotes

  * Hyperlinks 

  * autocite?


### Footntes

You can also use math in footnotes like this[^40-examples-1]. Footnotes
are helpful because they either open to a new page, where you can
re-link to where you left off. Or they display as a literal footnote,
depending on your file format.

[^40-examples-1]: where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^40-examples-2]

[^40-examples-2]: $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard
    error will be approximated

    $$
    SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
    $$

Anything that maintains the indent following the html tag (square
brackets) will be included in the footnote and **excluded** from the
actual rendered text. This could be helpful to easily provide more
information without breaking the narrative; however, it has the drawback
that footnotes are dispersed throughout the document.

**NOTE:** Footnote labels can be any character string, but for our own
sakes, it makes sense to follow a standard, descriptive, format.

To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to
install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): <https://yihui.name/tinytex/>.

### Hyperlinks


In short, if you **label** it, you can link to it. So it's good practice to
**LABEL EVERYTHING DESCRIPTIVELY** in case you it later. There are a couple of differnt styles of labeling depending on what you want to link to. You already saw above how to link to a website (URL). 

* code chunks that produce figures can be referenced via `@\ref(fig:[LABEL])`





#### Link to chapters


You can label chapter, section, or any level of header (`##`) using by including the label in curly brackets after the section. 
  * e.g., we can reference \@ref(unit1_ch1) using the following: 
    + `\@ref(unit1_ch1)` 
  

**NOTE:** If you do not manually label sections, they will get automatic labels anyway, which are hard to reference, so best to just declare them. 




#### Link to figures, tables, or code chunks



You can link to figures or tables created by R code, or the R code itself, as long as they are labeled. 
**Be careful!!** if labels are not descriptive and informative, it might be hard to find them later. 
  * We should decide on some conventions for this!*
  

Whatever the output (figure, table, etc), the label follows the r at the very first line of the code chunk:
  * ````{r an_example}`
  * ````{r an_example, fig.cap = "Example that include additional code chunk parameters"}`
  

To include the link in text, use the `\@ref()`.

To link to the code itself, we simply call the label (just like linking to a section header).
  * `\@ref(basic_code)` Link to some basic code \@ref(basic_code) 


If the output is a figure, you will also need to preface the label with `fig:`
  *  `\@ref(fig:height_boxplot)`. Is the code that produces this link to a figure \@ref(fig:height_boxplot) 
  
In order to reference a nicely formatted table, made with  `knitr::kable()`, use the following:
  * `\@ref(tab:height_table)`. In order to reference *this table* \@ref(tab:height_table) 
  
  
  
#### Link to websites


linking to external websites is easy, just include the [text-to-be-hyperlinked](https://ehrlichd.github.io/ipumsEDbook)

This is actuall the exact same as linking to a local .jpg or similar.

### Citations



There do appera to be tools for citations, but I'm not super familiar with them so this section will grow as I learn more.



#### Citing R packages


You can easily gather a list of all R packages used in a project using  `knitr::write_bib()`.
By using square brackets and the `@` sign, along with the package name? or maybe the github repo? I'm not entirely sure, see below 


Quick example from demo/index (may not work without write_bib() though):
we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book,
which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015]. 

  * This infor should be written to the References files, though i'm not sure if it will work
