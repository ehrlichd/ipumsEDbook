# The Basics {#unit1}


For now, I have 3 main chapters for each of the main sections: 
  * Basics of data science / R \@ref(unit1) 
  * Applications/critiques using IPUMS data \@ref(unit2)
  * Student-driven projects \@ref(unit3)

Each of these **Chapters** contains multiple sections. We'll likely want to break these sections out into their own `.Rmd` files as they get fleshed out. For now, I'll try to keep the abundance of files limited.

**NOTE:** As these actually get filled out, we will probably want to insert different `part`s to the book (EG, the content of Unit 1 is covered in `Part I`).
  * Declare parts with `# (PART) Part I {-}` immediately before the first chapter `#` it contains.
