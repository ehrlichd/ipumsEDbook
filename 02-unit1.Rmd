# The Basics {#unit1}


For now, I have 3 main chapters for each of the main sections: 
  * Basics of data science / R \@ref(unit1) 
  * Applications/critiques using IPUMS data \@ref(unit2)
  * Student-driven projects \@ref(unit3)

Each of these **Chapters** contains multiple sections. We'll likely want to break these sections out into their own `.Rmd` files as they get fleshed out. For now, I'll try to keep the abundance of files limited.

**NOTE:** As these actually get filled out, we will probably want to insert different `part`s to the book (EG, the content of Unit 1 is covered in `Part I`).
  * Declare parts with `# (PART) Part I {-}` immediately before the first chapter `#` it contains.
  
**Topics to include:**
  * What is data?
  * Everything can be data
  * How do we interpret data
  * Tables
  * Plots
  * Univariate distributions
  * What can they tell us
  * Multi-modality in distributions
  * Categorical vs continuous data
  * Donâ€™t need to get ahead of this yet
  * Add in a grouping category - multi state/multi-national dataset
  * Ttest / anova

**Type of Data:**
Age distributions
Specifically generate a dataset with old/young folks over-represented to highlight a bimodal distribution

Start with single state/country
Add a second state/country to demo ttest
Add more to demo anova

Alternatively, income by education level - may be more interesting/relevant to college students (or depressing)

## Intro to R/RStudio
## Reading Data / Distributions
### What *is* a **normal distribution**
#### How normal is it?
show increasingly unclear examples of normal vs not

introduce tests of normality

#### Measuring normality - single sample

reinforce [concept of statistical] **normality**

is a value from a sample? - one way ttest
something about tails

#### comparing normality - two saples

standard / two-way t test

#### comparing more than two - ANOVA
