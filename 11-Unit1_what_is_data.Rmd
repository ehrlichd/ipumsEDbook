## Explain 

### WHAT ARE DATA

Data are defined as “facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis.”1 As seen in Figure 1.1, there are two types of data: quantitative and qualitative. Quantitative data are able to be expressed in numerical format and are countable. These data are either discrete or continuous where discrete data uses numeric bins. For example, we use our age as discrete quantitative data, we round our age to the previous year (eg., 20, 21, 22). Continuous data does not use bins, but rather includes all of the fractions between two whole numbers. An example could be most physical measures like height, weight, the speed at which an individual runs.
Qualitative data describe characteristics or categories and can be broken down into two categories, nominal or ordinal. Nominal data have no inherent ordering but it can be categorized. Examples include country or origin, gender, hair color, race, etc. Ordinal data can both be categorized and ordered (e.g., first, second, and third place is a race).
Going back to our hypothesis of male height on campus, heights are continuous, qualitative data. It is difficult for people to report their specific height and you assume that most individuals will report it rounded to the closest inch. This makes the data you will actually use, discrete quantitative data.



> *Fun fact: A single data point is called a datum which is Latin for “something given”. The word data can be either singular or plural depending on how you use it. It can be used as a mass noun the same way we discuss sand on a beach or hair on our head. However, in science we are usually referring to multiple datums within a data set making it a plural noun. Therefore, data is cool and data are cool!*

### COLLECTING DATA

The first step to answering a research question is to collect your data. Broadly, data comes in two forms, primary and secondary. (Fig 1.2) Primary data are data that is collected directly by the researcher. Surveys, observations, experimentation, questionnaires, and interviews are all examples of primary data. Secondary data are collected from published or unpublished literature. It is collected by different researchers and compiled for use by a second scientist. These types of data include data found in published articles, books, journals, biographies, and government records like the US Census.


Once compiled, you now have a data set which is composed of observations and variables. An observation is all of the measures taken for one person or item. A variable is what is being measured.


The US CDC data is secondary, but you are collecting height data yourself in class as a comparison. The survey or questionnaire you use on your classmates is primary data. Each individual is an observation and the variable of interest is height.

#### TYPES OF DATA

There are a lot of different ways to record observations. Its important to choose an appropriate format to record your data. Some pretty broad categories are:

* Yes/No
* Tallies
* Categorization
* Measurments
* Open-ended text

If you were to ask your friend: "What is your favorite food?" You would not expect
them to give an answer of "yes" or "no". Asking an open-ended question often/always prompts an open-ended response. This can be informative and inclusive, allowing respondents to answer with exactly the answer they feel best answers the question. However, it can make analyzing and drawing interpretations from the data dificult to impossible!

If instead, we ask "Is your favorite food pizza?" We expect a yes/no answer. Asking this question of 100 people, we can easily answer the question "What percentage of people's favorite food is pizza?"

##### Continuous vs categorical

One of the biggest differences in classifying data is based on the uniuque values we expect from the data. Continuous variables are...

Categorical variables can be ordered (EG Factors, ordinations) or they can be undoredered (EG, categories)

###  POPULATIONS AND SAMPLING


**Random Sampling:** It is a sampling method in which all the items have an equal chance of being selected and the individuals who are selected are just like the ones who are not selected

**Stratified Random Sampling:** It is a process to gather data by separating the actual population into the distinct subset or strata, and then choosing simple random samples from each stratum Your research question is about the height of all males at your college but recording height data for each individual would be very difficult and time consuming. You instead decide to use a sample of males in your data science class. This is a random sample as each male individual has an equally likely chance of being samples (that is, unless a prerequisite exists).


Sampling strategy can lead to bias. **Statistical bias** is a systematic tendency which causes differences between results and facts. If instead of your classmates, you had chosen a different sample, like the men’s basketball team, your results would have been biased as basketball players are taller on average.

we group categories a,b,c to make new groups for analysis.

In doing so, we limit our interpreations to _____



### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS


The first step in understanding and interpreting our data is called an exploratory data analysis. We will use a few measurements to quickly look at the data and then we can use some simple graphing techniques to turn our data into visualizations. The first three M’s, you are likely familiar with and are often referred to as measures of central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode. 
These go along with range, outliers and sample size. 


  * Mean
  * Median
  * Mode
  * Outlier
  * Range

> What is a statistic?


### Exploring height

If you do not have class data on height, we will be using the following simple dataset of 5 individuals:

* Can you describe what is happening in the following `codechunk`??
* What do `person, height` represent in relationship to `ex_height`??
 
<details>
 <summary> *Click to show answer* </summary>
  <p> 
    We **create** the **R object** `ex_height` using the **assignment operator** `<-`
    `ex_height` is a **data.frame**, a table, with two columns: `person` and `height` <br>
    `person, height` are the two columns, or variables, of `ex_height`
  </p>
</details>

 
```{r}

ex_height <- data.frame(
  "person" = paste("Ind", 
                   c("a", "b","c","d","e"), 
                   sep = "_"),
  "height" = c(5.5, 5, 6, 5.25, 5)
)


```



```{r, results = 'asis'}


knitr::kable(ex_height)
```


### Mean height

You probably already know this one. The (arithmatic) mean is calculated by adding all **values** together, and dividing by the **number of observations**. For our dataset, we add all 5 heights together and divide by the number of individuals (5):

$\frac{(5.5 + 5 + 6 + 5.25 + 5)}{5}$
$\frac{26.75}{5}$
$5.35$

In `r`, we can write this out "by hand." Since `r` is a **statistical programming language**, r recognizes basic mathematical expressions. We can `code` the following to calcualte the mean:


```{r}

(5.5 + 5 + 6 + 5.25 + 5)/5

```



Since `r` is an **object-oriented programming language**, we don't need to write out individual numbers for each calculation. Instead, we can refer to the `ex_height` **object**. Since `ex_height` is a **data.frame**, we can refer to it variables by name with the `$` operator. We also take advantage of some of the built-in mathematical functions of `r`: `sum(), length()`

```{r}

sum(ex_height$height)/length(ex_height$person)

```

### Median height

The **median** is calculated by ordering all values from small to large. If there are an **odd** numberof values, there will be a single value at the middle. 

Our original data:
$ 5.5, 5, 6,  5.25,  5$

Our data re-ordered from small to large:
$ 5, 5, 5.25, 5.5, 6 $ 

$ ~~5, 5,~~ 5.25, ~~5.5, 6 ~~ $ 

~~5, 5,~~ 5.25, ~~5.5, 6~~


If we had an even number of values, we would wind up with two "middle values", in which case we take the mean of these two. 

If we had one more value, let's say `5.75`, we wind up with both `5.25` and `5.5` as middle values. 


$ 5, 5, ~~5.25, 5.5,~~ 5.75, 6 $


The median is the **mean** of these two values:

$\frac{5.25+5.5}{2}$
$5.375$


In a small dataset, it's easy to pick out the middle value. Fortunately, there's an `r` function for this as well:


```{r}

## With 5 Individuals 
median(ex_height$height)

## With 6 individuals
median(c(ex_height$height, 5.75))
```

> Did you notice the `c()` function above? What does it do?


### Modal height

The **mode** is the most common value in the dataset. Here again, it's easy to pick out there are 2 people with a `height` of `5`, and all other values are repsented by just one person. There's actually no build-in `r` function to calculate the **mode**...


But don't worry, there are functions that let you decide the **mode** and more!! A very useful function is `table()`, used to make **counts** of values. In a small dataset, we see that two individuals have a height of 5. Our **mode** is 5!

```{r}

table(ex_height$height)

```



### Range

The **range** of the data is two numbers, the lowest, and highest values within the data:

```{r}

range(ex_height$height)

```


Though, if you want just the **minimum** or **maximum** value, you can use `min()` or `max():

```{r}

min(ex_height$height)
max(ex_height$height)
```




### Outliers

So far, some of these examples may have so obvious you may be thinking: *what's the point??*

For a slightly more practical demonstration, try out the above functions on your `class_data`. If you don't have class data available you can access the 


## Elaborate

### Your Turn! (*would we have done this before or is this the first time??*)

For this example, you can use data collected in class, or the example dataset available in `ipumsED` R package: `class_ipums_data`

For in-class *survey* data, you are looking at the age of each individual in class. 
For the IPUMS data, you are looking at age as recorded in the American Community Survey
([ACS](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)). This survey is fielded 
annually. It contains more detailed questions that supplement the decennial census. **Raw data** are available directly from the [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html). However, we will be working with [IPUMS data](https://ipums.org), **harmonzied.**. This process standardizes variable coding schema across all samples within the IPUMS dataset. IPUMS makes it easy for researchers to conduct analysis across time and space. 

> IPUMS began as a PhD project digitizing historic US census data and reconciling
> it with the coding schema of the current US Census (1990s). IPUMS-International grew out
> of this by employing our harmonization practices on Census samples from other countries.
> IPUMS has partnerships with over 100 countries and is working on building partnerships with the 
> remainng **82** countries!
>
> Partnerships with IPUMS may look slightly different for each country, but they always
> involve IPUMS commitment to being responsible stewards of the partner-country's data.
> Our goal is to make data as open as possible, while maintaining responsible disclosure risk controls.


Example data used throughout this book come from IPUMS-International so that values may be contextualized for a readers interested in one of the 103 countries that have data sharing agreements with IPUMS.



Write and `Rscript` that reads in your chosen dataset, and calculates the 
following statistics:

* `mean()`
* `meadian()`
* **mode**
* `range()`

In addition, include at least one plot or table and use it to discuss if your dataset contains any outliers. What criteria are you using to define an outlier?
