# Example RMD code {#ex_code}
 
For now, this chapter is a bit of a placeholder. I'm not sure what/how the `references.Rmd` file actually fits in to the code/construction (it looks automatic) so I want to keep that in place and need a section to note that. 

I also want a more centralized reference point to put any example code I find helpful while working in R/bookdown. This section could get really unrully really fast, but oh well.



## Core

`index.Rmd` is required and treated as file `00`. Chapters *should* be numbered for ease of sorting but custom orders are possible by specifying filenames somewhere **in this file**


Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.
  + **IE** beyond the YAML header this file functions as a normal chapter since it starts with a top level header.
  + Note that `index.Rmd` has its own YMAL in addition to the various .yml files...not sure exactly how these relate.

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:norm_dist_plot). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:norm_summary_tab).
  * Again, this prints an auto-generated numeral
  * also leaving this in the context of the plots in Chapter \@ref(unit2)
  

You can write citations, too. See `knitr::write_bib()` for more on this. Quick example from demo/index (may not work without write_bib() though): we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
  * If included, "Refernces" section gets added to each chapter. 
  * Not exactly sure where


Embed html renders (EG, fancy tables (IPUMS_var_desc), or any shiny app) with `webshot` R package and `phantomJS`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("webshot")
webshot::install_phantomjs()
```
  
  
Embed figures from a folder.

For this, it's usually best to use a code-chunk and `knitr`. There are a number of graphical paramerters you can set (or ignore)
`out.width` will scale your image accordingly - irrespective of unit/display
`fig.align` should be "left", "right", or "center"
`fig.cap` allows you to provide "mouse over" captions for the image. 
`echo=FALSE` is important if you ONLY want the image (IE the result of the code). If you want the code itself to show, (IE, or echo) set `echo=TRUE`.


```{r, out.width= '50%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='the ipums logo', echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/ipums_i_logo.jpg")
```
## Tips

***Autonumber sections** Note the `{-}` used to indicate "do not number this section" eg: preface.

**LABEL EVERYTHING** you'll likely want to reference it later
  * code chunks that produce figures can be referenced via `@\ref(fig:[LABEL])`
  

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(unit1). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway,
  * No idea how the automatic references work, so always be sure to declare them.
  * **NOTE** these display as the relevant Chapter `numeral`.

### Math

Randal Pruim features an extensive list of common math expression on their [github page](https://rpruim.github.io/s341/S19/from-class/MathinRmd.html). Here are some quick notes: 

In-line equations can be written within `$` and will be displayed right there: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. In contrast, you can also add equation chunks by using `$$` 

This can be coded in-line,  $$\sum_{n=1}^{10} n^2$$, but will result in a page break.


Alternatively, a more "classic" equation chunk:

$$
Plain text doesnt get spaces

how

very



odd

$$


#### more math example


$p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

$$
SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
$$

You can also use math in footnotes like this^[where we mention $p = \frac{a}{b}$]. Footnotes are helpful because they re-link to where you left off.

We will approximate standard error to 0.027[^longnote]

[^longnote]: $p$ is unknown but expected to be around 1/3. Standard error will be approximated

    $$
    SE = \sqrt(\frac{p(1-p)}{n}) \approx \sqrt{\frac{1/3 (1 - 1/3)} {300}} = 0.027
    $$

The `longnote` footnote seems particularly useful.
