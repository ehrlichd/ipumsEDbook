# Preface {-}


An open-source book using open-source tools and nearly open-source data.



## What is IPUMS {-}


IPUMS started as a project to digitize the historical records of the US census. It has expanded to include [9 data collections](https://www.ipums.org/), which are united in their methods and principles of making soial science research easier. IPUMS data consists of individual-level census and survey data from more than 100 countries around the world. Notably: 

  * IPUMS **harmonizes** these data, ensuring consistently coded values across time and space.
  * IPUMS provides harmonized **GIS Shapefiles** for most census and survey data
  * IPUMS provides extensive **metadata**, including
    + Original questionnaire text
    + Alerts about notable changes in variable definition, universe, or coding
    
    
IPUMS data is free to use for education and research purposes. Researchers just need to register with an **email address** and brief project description. Nothing too formal - we're just trying to understand what kinds of questions researchers are interested in. For educators, we have additional resources to set up [classroom accounts](), making it easy to get your students registered and share IPUMS data with them.



## Why make this course {-}


While we (DEE) may be slightly biased, we think IPUms is a fantastic resource for **Education** and **Research**. Real-world example datasets provide the bulk of the content for this course, providing an **applied context** we hope students (and instructors) will find engaging. We also know meany instructors may be teaching across multiple disciplines, in large departments, or be the only "data person" at their instutition. We think IPUMS data will be useful to virtually any social science field. We provide some example lessons, and encourage instructors to develop their own, using our `template`, to tailor this course to their subject or interest.


# Course Description {-}

This course is broken down into 3, 5-week units. Unit 1 focuses on familiarizing yourself with R and the IPUMS dataset. In Unit 2, each week will showcase a method/analysis using preselected variables. In class, students will walk through a given problem set and produce a lab report by the end of class. In Unit 3, students will work towards answering a research question that they pose, creating a research paper with literature review, data analysis, conclusion, and data outputs.


## Course Aims {-}

Provide students with relevant, hands on, methodological training in data literacy and visualization. 



## Learning Outcomes {-}

After this course, students will be able to:

  * Understand the depth of the IPUMS database and the variables it has to  
offer

  * Compose R code to analyze the IPUMS data
  
  * Produce visually pleasing data outputs in R
  
  * Synthesize the information in a written report
  
  * Present the analysis in a poster format for other students



## Guiding Principles {-}

* phenomenon-based learning
  + try to start the class with a **question** or **problem**
  + *why* does the data look the way it does
  + structure class so students work towards solving the problem

* RELEVANT examples
  + try to touch on 2 or more disciplines (eg, economics, demography)




# Syllabus {-}


This syllabus is initially envisioned as 3 5-week sections. However, compilation and content are intended to be modular with templates for instructors to include their own specialties.

The basic structure of this course is:

Unit 1 (Weeks 1-5): Understanding and Testing Data

  * Students use simple datasets 
    + Data provided by the course/instructor
    + simplified data to illustrate trends
      + EG: Age distributions ; Age by Sex
      + potential usecase for synthesized data

Unit 2 (Weeks 6-10): Finding Data and Asking Questions

  * Students begin to analyze more complex (IPUMS) datasets
    + Data provided by course/instructor
    + IPUMS data testing/demonstrating real world effects 
      + EG: SEX ~ EDUATTAIN ; Sex by eduattain by some SES indicators
    + Students are given a medium/large set of IPUMS variables
      + Students learn to perform exploratory analysis to guide hypotheses 
  * Students learn to navigate IPUMS website
    + Students learn to develop a hypothesis and find relevant data
    
Unit 3 (Weeks 11-15): Discussing Data and Student Research 

  * Students develop a research question to be answered with IPUMS data
    + Students are encouraged to fit it to their interests/major/disciplie
  * Course time should be devoted to individual/small-group research
  * Instructor/class present on recent research
    + Instructor models constructive / scholarly criticism 
    + Encourage students to critque published work - responsibly


### Unit 1 (5 weeks) Understanding and Testing Data {-}

#### Week 1: Intro to R, data types, data structures {-}
#### Week 2: Plotting Data, Distributions{-}
#### Week 3: Statisitcal testing of simple data sets{-}
#### Week 4: Correlation and Relationships of simple data sets {-}
#### Week 5: (TBD) {-}

#### Addl Details  {-}

Intro to data/ simple analysis

Students will be able to:

Technical:

* Download R and RStudio
* Read data into R and
* Write (save) data out of R.
* Summarize data visually
  + Using base R
  + Using ggplot (tidyverse)
* Summarize data tabularly
  + Using base R
  + Using gttable / tidyverse
* Formally state and test assumptions of data
  + *EG:* t-test, anova, (maybe) correlations

Conceptual:

* Understand main types of data
  + *EG:* logical, numeric, character, etc
  + R specic vs general terms
* Recgonize various data distributions
  + *EG:* normal, poisson, etc
* Know which types statistical tests are appropriate for a given set of data.


### Unit 2 Finding Data and Asking Questions (Using IPUMS Data)  {-}


#### Week 6 Exploratory analysis {-}
#### Week 7 Hypothesis Testing {-}
#### Week 8 Statistical Inference {-}
#### Week 9 (TBD) {-}
#### Week 10 (TBD) {-}

#### Addl Details  

Here we demonstrate two **different** approaches to conducting research. Students become familar writing up short lab reports detailing their findings. For unit \@ref(expo), we/instructor provides students with simple datasets from IPUMS (or other real-world data). Students will learn exploratory data analysis techniques and how to create lab reports to summarize key findings. 

For unit \@ref(hypo), students will learn to develop their own simple research questions or social-science hypotheses. They will seek out data to answer these questions, learning to navigate [ipums.org](https://ipums.org), and create **data extracts**, as well as hypothesis-testing statistical methods. Again, lab reports to summarize findings. 

##### Exploratory Analysis {#expo}  

If you've just collected a survey, or other raw data, you may not know what you're looking for. This is perfectly ok but goes against *the scientific method* most people learned in grade school (More on that to follow(**_include_link_**)).

This unit begins by presenting data/distributions and asking students to begin interpreting the data . visual exploration is encouraged and basic of data manipulation are taught
  * *EG:* how to subset data, how to reshape data, how to recode data, how to convert from one `data type` to another.
  
Example lab exercise:

Students given a data set (xls, csv, etc)
  * load data, perform manipulations, basic summaries
    + cross tabs
    + group means by a covariate
  * inspect data visually
    + *DESCRIBE* the distribution - is it normal? significant?
  * *FIND* aquestion in the spread of the data
    + how can you test this (maybe small group work)
  * write up/ present results
    + think on confounding factors / biases
    
    
  
##### Hypotethsis Driven {#hypo}

If, on the other hand you have an a pre-exisiting idea you want to test. We can follow the traditional *scientific method*. With a question in mind, the first question is: where to look. What better place than [IPUMS](https://ipums.org)!

Begin introducing navigation of web resources - mainly IPUMS international

Students should become comfortable working through lab exercises:
  * Define a question (or be presented with one)
  * Download variables from IPUMS (course downloads possible)
  * Perform a basic analysis (discussed in Unit 1)
  * Generate a **visual argument** for your analysis
    + Include explanation/interpretation/reflection on the question at hand, and the data used
    + Any obvious biases
    + Any obvious confounding factors




### Unit 3 Discussing Data and Student Research  {-}

#### Week 11: Students develop research Question {-}
#### Week 12: Students find relevant variables from IPUMS {-}
#### Week 13: Students test and evaluate results {-}
#### Week 14: Students prepare presentations of results {-}
#### Week 15: Students present work (slides, poster, podium, etc) {-}

#### Addl Details  

Students will select their own research question that can be answered with the IPUMS data set and will spend five weeks producing a research paper complete with data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.


In this section we encourage the instructor to provide ample time for independent student/small-group research. Some class time should be devoted to modelling healthy discussion and critique of methods.

We provide some examples here but encourage instructors (or students) to bring in recent journal/popular articles that do (or do not) apply data science methods well.





# DEV NOTES {-}

##### TO DO {-}

* Make chapter 1 chapter 2
* Anna Adds chapter con data science intro exclusive of R/IPUMS

* discuss style
  + key terms section for each chapter?
  + key terms in **bold**
  + italics for *emphasis*
  + are we pro-hyphens, or are they pedantic?


##### MISC IDEAS {-}

* Application forward
* Present research/ analysis/results FIRST, then explain the mathematical principals behind it
* daily/weekly “i’m stuck on…” 
  + Students send in questions (night before class) and instructor spends 10-15 mins talking through (or collaboratively working through with class) solutions
  + Alternatively, once a month maybe a longer class covering “common problems asked this month”
daily/weekly “recent research”
* pick out a recent article with good visualization (or bad) and spend 5-10 mins discussing what makes it good (or bad)
  + Encourage students to find articles for extra credit


##### Documentation {-}

This function grabs any packages in your project and adds them to a local list that can be referenced using `R-pacakgename`
  * **NOTE** in practice, that needs to be wrapped in markdown syntax, eg:
    `[@R-bookdown]`
  * See help files for more info - might be able to create/add a `citation` file
    
```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
