# Preface {-}

This is my very first bookdown book. I hope you like it.

**TIP:** Note the `{-}` used to indicate "do not number this section" eg: preface.

## TO DO

* discuss style
  + key terms section for each chapter?
  + key terms in **bold**
  + italics for *emphasis*
  + are we pro-hyphens, or are they pedantic?

## GUIDING PRINCIPLES

* phenomenon-based learning
  + try to start the class with a **question** or **problem**
  + *why* does the data look the way it does
  + structure class so students work towards solving the problem

* RELEVANT examples
  + try to touch on 2 or more disciplines (eg, economics, demography)
  

#### Documentation

This function grabs any packages in your project and adds them to a local list that can be referenced using `R-pacakgename`
  * **NOTE** in practice, that needs to be wrapped in markdown syntax, eg:
    `[@R-bookdown]`
  * See help files for more info - might be able to create/add a `citation` file
    
```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
