# Preface {-}

This is my very first bookdown book. I hope you like it.

# Syllabus Details {-}


## Course Aims {-}

Provide students with relevant, hands on, methodological training in data literacy and visualization. 



## Course Description {-}

This course is broken down into 3, 5-week units. Unit 1 focuses on familiarizing yourself with R and the IPUMS dataset. In Unit 2, each week will showcase a method/analysis using preselected variables. In class, students will walk through a given problem set and produce a lab report by the end of class. In Unit 3, students will work towards answering a research question that they pose, creating a research paper with literature review, data analysis, conclusion, and data outputs.


## LEARNING OUTCOMES {-}

LEARNING OUTCOMES: 
  * Understand the depth of the IPUMS database and the variables it has to  
offer
  * Compose R code to analyze the IPUMS data
  * Produce visually pleasing data outputs in R
  * Synthesize the information in a written report
  * Present the analysis in a poster format for other students



## Guiding Principles {-}

* phenomenon-based learning
  + try to start the class with a **question** or **problem**
  + *why* does the data look the way it does
  + structure class so students work towards solving the problem

* RELEVANT examples
  + try to touch on 2 or more disciplines (eg, economics, demography)




## Weekly Schedule


This syllabus is initially envisioned as 3 5-week sections. However, compilation and content are intended to be modular with templates for instructors to include their own specialties.

The basic structure of this course is:

### Unit 1 Understanding and Testing Data

Intro to data/ simple analysis

Students will be able to:

Technical:

* Download R and RStudio
* Read data into R and
* Write (save) data out of R.
* Summarize data visually
  + Using base R
  + Using ggplot (tidyverse)
* Summarize data tabularly
  + Using base R
  + Using gttable / tidyverse
* Formally state and test assumptions of data
  + *EG:* t-test, anova, (maybe) correlations

Conceptual:

* Understand main types of data
  + *EG:* logical, numeric, character, etc
  + R specic vs general terms
* Recgonize various data distributions
  + *EG:* normal, poisson, etc
* Know which types statistical tests are appropriate for a given set of data.


### Unit 2 Finding Data and Asking Questions

Here we demonstrate two **different** approaches to conducting research. Students become familar writing up short lab reports detailing their findings. For unit \@ref(expo), we/instructor provides students with simple datasets from IPUMS (or other real-world data). Students will learn exploratory data analysis techniques and how to create lab reports to summarize key findings. 

For unit \@ref(hypo), students will learn to develop their own simple research questions or social-science hypotheses. They will seek out data to answer these questions, learning to navigate [ipums.org](https://ipums.org), and create **data extracts**, as well as hypothesis-testing statistical methods. Again, lab reports to summarize findings. 

#### Exploratory Analysis {#expo}

If you've just collected a survey, or other raw data, you may not know what you're looking for. This is perfectly ok but goes against *the scientific method* most people learned in grade school (More on that to follow(**_include_link_**)).

This unit begins by presenting data/distributions and asking students to begin interpreting the data . visual exploration is encouraged and basic of data manipulation are taught
  * *EG:* how to subset data, how to reshape data, how to recode data, how to convert from one `data type` to another.
  
Example lab exercise:

Students given a data set (xls, csv, etc)
  * load data, perform manipulations, basic summaries
    + cross tabs
    + group means by a covariate
  * inspect data visually
    + *DESCRIBE* the distribution - is it normal? significant?
  * *FIND* aquestion in the spread of the data
    + how can you test this (maybe small group work)
  * write up/ present results
    + think on confounding factors / biases
    
    
  
#### Hypotethsis Driven {#hypo}

If, on the other hand you have an a pre-exisiting idea you want to test. We can follow the traditional *scientific method*. With a question in mind, the first question is: where to look. What better place than [IPUMS](https://ipums.org)!

Begin introducing navigation of web resources - mainly IPUMS international

Students should become comfortable working through lab exercises:
  * Define a question (or be presented with one)
  * Download variables from IPUMS (course downloads possible)
  * Perform a basic analysis (discussed in Unit 1)
  * Generate a **visual argument** for your analysis
    + Include explanation/interpretation/reflection on the question at hand, and the data used
    + Any obvious biases
    + Any obvious confounding factors




### Unit 3 Discussing Data and Student Research 

Students will select their own research question that can be answered with the IPUMS data set and will spend five weeks producing a research paper complete with data analysis, visualization, and interpretation.


In this section we encourage the instructor to provide ample time for independent student/small-group research. Some class time should be devoted to modelling healthy discussion and critique of methods.

We provide some examples here but encourage instructors (or students) to bring in recent journal/popular articles that do (or do not) apply data science methods well.



# DEV NOTES {-}

## TO DO {-}

* discuss style
  + key terms section for each chapter?
  + key terms in **bold**
  + italics for *emphasis*
  + are we pro-hyphens, or are they pedantic?


## MISC IDEAS {-}

* Application forward
* Present research/ analysis/results FIRST, then explain the mathematical principals behind it
* daily/weekly “i’m stuck on…” 
  + Students send in questions (night before class) and instructor spends 10-15 mins talking through (or collaboratively working through with class) solutions
  + Alternatively, once a month maybe a longer class covering “common problems asked this month”
daily/weekly “recent research”
* pick out a recent article with good visualization (or bad) and spend 5-10 mins discussing what makes it good (or bad)
  + Encourage students to find articles for extra credit


## Documentation {-}

This function grabs any packages in your project and adds them to a local list that can be referenced using `R-pacakgename`
  * **NOTE** in practice, that needs to be wrapped in markdown syntax, eg:
    `[@R-bookdown]`
  * See help files for more info - might be able to create/add a `citation` file
    
```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
